- assessment: Learning Assessments, Object-Oriented Programming
  goals:
    - "**Data abstraction**: Apply abject-oriented design principles to separate interface from implementation."
    - "**Encapsulation**: Apply object-oriented design principles to design and build classes."
    - "**Subtype polymorphism**: Write polymorphic code that works for objects in all classes that implement an interface or subclass another class."
    - "**Parametric polymorphism**: Write polymorphic code for structures that can work with a variety of uniformly typed objects, such as lists of X."
    - "**Composition**: Combine objects/classes to build new objects/classes, implementing the _has-a_ relationship."
    - "**Inheritance**: Build new objects/classes in terms of other objects/classes, impliementing the _is-a_ relationship."
