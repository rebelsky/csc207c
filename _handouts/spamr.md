# [CSC-207 2024Fa] Quick notes on mini-projects (2024-09-13) 

Dear Mini-Projectors,

A variety of notes on mini-projects 1 and 2.

0. You do not need to tell me that you're using a token for an extension; I'll charge it automatically.

1. Because of the late release of the tests for mini-project 1, everyone gets a free two-day extension.

2. Mini-project 2 is ready for public release.

2'. I hope to have the autograder for mini-project 2 ready for you a bit more quickly.

As always, feel to reach out via email or Teams. (And if I don't respond with a reasonable amount of time, such as twelve hours, reach out again.)

Regards,

# [CSC-207 2024Fa] Some notes from SamR on MP1 (2024-09-07)

Dear Decipherers (of enciphered text and CS assignments),

I have a variety of things to share with you about MP1.

1. I've "graded" the first few pre-reflections (preflections?) and have released the graded work on Gradescope. You can check out my comments there.

2. I've posted answers to all the questions I received to the end of the mini project in the Questions and Answers section.

3. If you haven't done the pre-reflections yet, for #3, I'd really like you to attempt a "brain dump". Don't just say "I'll need to write static methods and import methods from elsewhere. The goal is to actually get near-code out of your brain because it builds brain connections. What do static methods look like? What do main methods look like? What does an import statement look like?

4. Don't forget that there's a mentor session on Sunday night at 7pm in 3819. You earn a token for attending mentor sessions (and reporting on them to the extra credit page).

5. I should have unit tests ready for you by Tuesday. We'll be using those instead of an autograder on Gradescope.

6. Also a reminder: Our class mentors are only available to you during class and at mentor sessions. If you need help at other times, you should rely on the evening tutors. If you happen to see our class mentors in our classroom or on Noyce 3rd at other times, they are likely working on their own work.

## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Maven reading posted (2024-09-01) 

Dear Array-ngers

The Maven reading is now posted at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/readings/maven.html> . It has way too much output, particularly in comparison to the content. Feel free to skim.

## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Reading responses for Tuesday (2024-08-31)

Dear Stack Specifiers,

I hope you are well and that your weekend is going well.

I'm still working on the reading on Maven. But I can tell you in advance that there will be no double-dagger problems in that reading. So feel free to do the other readings. I hope to have the Maven reading ready tonight.

As always, questions are welcome via teams and email.

Regards,

## [CSC-207-02 2024Fa] The second half of Thursday's class / the start of Tuesday's class (2024-08-31)

Dear CSC-207-02 Students,

I hope you are well and that you have some time to enjoy the weekend.

Sorry for leaving class early on Friday. We spent some time in the ER and then they admitted my wife.

Since you missed the second half of the class, the best thing is probably to watch the video recording of the second half of section 1 to get a sense of the kinds of things we'd talk about in designing things. (You can also check out the eboard.)

We have some doctor's appointments on Tuesday. I expect to be back in time for class, but if I'm not, you should start the lab without me. The instructions should be fairly clear and Garikai can help with the confusing parts.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Reading 1 graded (partially); Token opportunities (2024-08-28)

Dear CSC-207 Students,

I hope you are well and that you enjoyed today's campus gathering (if you chose to participate).

I've responded to all of the reading responses I've received so far and you can see them on Gradescope. My normal approach will be to give quick responses to all of the responses I receive by some time on the night before class and then to check off the remaining ones when I have a chance. Sometimes I'll just look at your questions.

Since some token activities are before section 2 on Thursday, I thought I'd mention the token activities for Thursday.

* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 11:00 a.m., JRC 101.
  President Anne F. Harris -
  _Moving Knowledge into Action: Initiatives and Actions in Year Two of the Strategic Plan_.
* Thursday, 2024-08-09, 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., Grinnell Museum of Art and environs.
  Student Night at the Museum.
* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., Central Park.
  _Ag Appreciation Day_.

See you Thursday!
