## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Reading 1 graded (partially); Token opportunities (2024-08-28)

Dear CSC-207 Students,

I hope you are well and that you enjoyed today's campus gathering (if you chose to participate).

I've responded to all of the reading responses I've received so far and you can see them on Gradescope. My normal approach will be to give quick responses to all of the responses I receive by some time on the night before class and then to check off the remaining ones when I have a chance. Sometimes I'll just look at your questions.

Since some token activities are before section 2 on Thursday, I thought I'd mention the token activities for Thursday.

* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 11:00 a.m., JRC 101.
  President Anne F. Harris -
  _Moving Knowledge into Action: Initiatives and Actions in Year Two of the Strategic Plan_.
* Thursday, 2024-08-09, 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., Grinnell Museum of Art and environs.
  Student Night at the Museum.
* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., Central Park.
  _Ag Appreciation Day_.

See you Thursday!

## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Welcome to the course! (2024-08-26)

Dear CSC-207 Students,

Welcome to the course!

I hope you've had a great summer and that you're energized for a new semester of learning. I'm glad to see so many awesome students I know moving on to CSC-207, and I look forward to meeting those I don't know.

This message is your first course message ("Spam from Sam") for the semester.

The draft course Web site is now up and running at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/> .

You'll be able to see the syllabus, schedule, and the normal variety of handouts. There will probably be some changes before the start of the semester, but most of the key information is there.

You have some assignments to complete before the first day of class.

* Skim [the syllabus](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/syllabus/) and bring questions to class.
* Skim [the schedule](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/schedule/) and bring questions to class.

You should also check that you can log in to the class Team and to the class Gradescope instance.

Feel free to send along questions via email or Teams DM.
