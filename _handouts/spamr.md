## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Welcome to the course! (2024-08-26)

Dear CSC-207 Students,

Welcome to the course!

I hope you've had a great summer and that you're energized for a new semester of learning. I'm glad to see so many awesome students I know moving on to CSC-207, and I look forward to meeting those I don't know.

This message is your first course message ("Spam from Sam") for the semester.

The draft course Web site is now up and running at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/> .

You'll be able to see the syllabus, schedule, and the normal variety of handouts. There will probably be some changes before the start of the semester, but most of the key information is there.

You have some assignments to complete before the first day of class.

* Skim [the syllabus](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/syllabus/) and bring questions to class.
