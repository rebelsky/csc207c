## [CSC-207-01 2024Sp] Welcome to the course / Work for day one (2024-01-20)

Dear CSC-207-01 Students,

Welcome back to campus! I hope that you had a good break and that you are finding ways to stay warm. I have some notes and work for you as you get ready for the first day of class. Let's see …

0. You can find the course Web site at https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/

1. We will be meeting in Science 3813 ("the CSC-151 classroom") rather than Science 3815 ("the CSC-161 classroom"). I look forward to seeing you there Monday at 1pm.

2. When students come back together from across the world, they tend to bring back illnesses from across the world. I'd recommend that you consider masking. I will do my best to ensure that there are masks at the back of the classroom.

3. Most of the readings in our course will be materials I've written for the course. I will also assign some readings from CLRS (aka Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, _Introduction to Algorithms_, aka "The brick"). You can access CLRS for free through Grinnell's library.

4. I'd like you to do three short-ish readings before the first day of class. You need not understand them completely. Bring questions.

    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/readings/designing-adts.html>
    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/readings/designing-data-structures.html>

5. You may also find it useful to review the syllabus and schedule. Both are still under development.

6. At some point in the near future, you will need an account on GitHub. You may find it useful to sign up for one sooner rather than later. Note that I will be asking you to post things publicly, so you may want a separate GitHub account from your primary one.

7. These days, GitHub is easiest to use if you have an SSH keypair set up. There are instructions at <https://mathlan.sites.grinnell.edu/ssh/fastx/2019/07/22/Public-Private-Key-Pair/>.

Feel free to send me questions on Teams or via email if there are things you'd like to know before the first day of class.

Regards,
