## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Reading responses for Tuesday (2024-08-31)

Dear Stack Specifiers,

I hope you are well and that your weekend is going well.

I'm still working on the reading on Maven. But I can tell you in advance that there will be no double-dagger problems in that reading. So feel free to do the other readings. I hope to have the Maven reading ready tonight.

As always, questions are welcome via teams and email.

Regards,

## [CSC-207-02 2024Fa] The second half of Thursday's class / the start of Tuesday's class (2024-08-31)

Dear CSC-207-02 Students,

I hope you are well and that you have some time to enjoy the weekend.

Sorry for leaving class early on Friday. We spent some time in the ER and then they admitted my wife.

Since you missed the second half of the class, the best thing is probably to watch the video recording of the second half of section 1 to get a sense of the kinds of things we'd talk about in designing things. (You can also check out the eboard.)

We have some doctor's appointments on Tuesday. I expect to be back in time for class, but if I'm not, you should start the lab without me. The instructions should be fairly clear and Garikai can help with the confusing parts.

Regards,

## [CSC-207 2024Fa] Reading 1 graded (partially); Token opportunities (2024-08-28)

Dear CSC-207 Students,

I hope you are well and that you enjoyed today's campus gathering (if you chose to participate).

I've responded to all of the reading responses I've received so far and you can see them on Gradescope. My normal approach will be to give quick responses to all of the responses I receive by some time on the night before class and then to check off the remaining ones when I have a chance. Sometimes I'll just look at your questions.

Since some token activities are before section 2 on Thursday, I thought I'd mention the token activities for Thursday.

* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 11:00 a.m., JRC 101.
  President Anne F. Harris -
  _Moving Knowledge into Action: Initiatives and Actions in Year Two of the Strategic Plan_.
* Thursday, 2024-08-09, 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., Grinnell Museum of Art and environs.
  Student Night at the Museum.
* Thursday, 2024-08-29, 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., Central Park.
  _Ag Appreciation Day_.

See you Thursday!
