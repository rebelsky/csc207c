## [CSC-207-02 2024Sp] Pre-reflections for MP5

Dear Array Associators,

I've "graded" all of your pre-reflections for MP5. We'll discuss some key issues in class tomorrow. Feel free to bring new questions.

I've answered all of the questions I received and put them at the bottom of [the mini-project page](../mps/mp05).

See you Monday!

## [CSC-207-02 2024Sp] Finding SamR today (Thursday) (2024-02-01)

Dear Encryptors and Decryptors,

I was able to solve two "connect to GitHub" problems yesterday. Yay!

I'll be hanging out in our classroom (Science 3813) from 8:00-10:30 and from 2:00-3:30 today (Thursday) to answer questions from students. Perhaps I can help with your GitHub or VSCode problems, at least in MathLAN. I have one student who booked time at 10:00 a.m., but other than that, it will be more-or-less first come, first served.

Starting next week, my regular office hours will be Tuesday 10:00-11:30 and Thursday 2:00-3:30. I should have those up on bookings soon.

## [CSC-207-01 2024Sp] Welcome to the course / Work for day one (2024-01-20)

Dear CSC-207-01 Students,

Welcome back to campus! I hope that you had a good break and that you are finding ways to stay warm. I have some notes and work for you as you get ready for the first day of class. Let's see â€¦

0. You can find the course Web site at https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/

1. We will be meeting in Science 3813 ("the CSC-151 classroom") rather than Science 3815 ("the CSC-161 classroom"). I look forward to seeing you there Monday at 1pm.

2. When students come back together from across the world, they tend to bring back illnesses from across the world. I'd recommend that you consider masking. I will do my best to ensure that there are masks at the back of the classroom.

3. Most of the readings in our course will be materials I've written for the course. I will also assign some readings from CLRS (aka Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, _Introduction to Algorithms_, aka "The brick"). You can access CLRS for free through Grinnell's library.

    <https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/grinnell-ebooks/detail.action?docID=6925615>

4. I'd like you to do three short-ish readings before the first day of class. You need not understand them completely. Bring questions.

    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/readings/oop-basics.html>
    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/readings/designing-adts.html>
    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/readings/designing-data-structures.html>

5. You may also find it useful to review the syllabus and schedule. Both are still under development.

    * <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Sp/schedule/>

6. At some point in the near future, you will need an account on GitHub. You may find it useful to sign up for one sooner rather than later. Note that I will be asking you to post things publicly, so you may want a separate GitHub account from your primary one.

7. These days, GitHub is easiest to use if you have an SSH keypair set up. There are instructions at <https://mathlan.sites.grinnell.edu/ssh/fastx/2019/07/22/Public-Private-Key-Pair/>.

Feel free to send me questions on Teams or via email if there are things you'd like to know before the first day of class.

Regards,

-- SamR
