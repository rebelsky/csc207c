Although the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) provides comprehensive style guidelines, some students benefit from shorter guidelines. Here are some of the key guidelines we look for.

**Indentation**

* Use a _two space_ indent. Not tabs. Not four spaces. Two spaces!

**Capitalization**

* Class names are CamelCase and start with uppercase letters.
* Field, variable, and methods names are camelCase and start with lowercase
  letters.
* Constants are all caps, perhaps with underscores to separate words.

**Braces**

* In general, the open brace goes on the same line as a command (e.g.,
  the `if` or `while` and the close brace goes on a line by itself,
  at the same indent as the command.
* Sam suggests that you comment your end-braces. That is not part of
  the Google standard.
* Please put a space before the open brace.

**Spaces**

* Make sure to have a space after each keyword. 
* Make sure to have a space before each open paren and after each
  close paren. 
    * The space after a keyword and before an open paren can be
      the same space.  For example, write `if (TEST)`.
* Don't put a space immediately after an open paren or before a close paren.
