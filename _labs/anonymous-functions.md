title: Anonymous functions
summary: |
  We explore the use of anonymous functions (or at least anonymous functional classes) in Java.
---
## Preparation

a. Review the documentation for the `Predicate` interface, available
at <{{ site.java_api }}/java/util/function/Predicate.html>.

b. Review the documentation for the `Function` interface, available
at <{{ site.java_api }}/java/util/function/Function.html>.

c. Review the documentation for the `Comparator` interface, available
at <{{ site.java_api }}/java/util/Comparator.html>.

d. Open [the _Java Tutorials_ page on lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html).

e. Fork and clone the repository at <https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/lab-anonymous-procedures>.

f. Review the code in the repository.

e. Create a new class, `ListUtils`, that you will use for some of the exercises.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Reviewing the reading

_Driver: **Alternating**

In the section entitled "Ideal Use Case for Lambda Expressions" in
the reading, the authors present nine different approaches to
filtering a list.  Write a program that experimentally verifies
that each of the nine approaches works as described.  You will do
this in `JTLambdaExperiments`.

You will likely need to 

* _Driver **A**_ Make a copy of the [`Person`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/examples/Person.java) class associated with the reading, which is available at <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/examples/Person.java>. 
* In the `main` method of `JTLambdaExperiments`, create a list of `Person` objects.  (We'd recommend an `ArrayList`.)
  You can see the `createRoster` method in `Person` for an example.
* _Driver **A** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and **B** (2, 4, 6, 8).) For each static method in the reading, add the method to `JTLambdaExperiment` and then add a call to that method to `main` to see that the method behaves as expected.

*Note*: If you are adding interfaces and classes, you should do so outside
the body of `JTLambdaExperiments`.

*Note*: I apologize for the sex binary in the `Person` class.

### Exercise 2: Selecting values

_Driver: **B**_

a. In `ListUtils`, write a static generic method, `select(List<T>
vals, Predicate<T> pred)`, that creates a new `ArrayList<T>` that contains
only the elements of `vals` for which the predicate holds.

b. In the `main` method of `LambdaExperiments`, select and print
the values in `strings` whose length is at least five.  Make sure
to define your predicate using a lambda.

c. In the `main` method of `LambdaExperiments`, select the values
in `strings` which contain two vowels in a row.  Once again, make
sure to define your predicate anonymously.

### Exercise 3: Removing values

_Driver: **A**_

Rather than building a new list by selecting values, as in the
previous problem, we could also write a method that mutates an
existing list by removing values.

a. In `ListUtils`, write a static generic method, `remove(List<T>
vals, Predicate<T>)`, that removes from vals any values for which
the predicate holds.  You may not use any existing methods in the
`List` class other than `iterator`.  You can assume that the `remove`
method is implemented in the given iterator.

b. Extend your program to remove the values in `strings` whose length is 
at least five.

c. Extend your program to instead remove the values in strings which 
contain two vowels in a row.

### Exercise 4: Extrema

_Driver: **B**_

Another common generic task is to find the largest (or smallest)
value in a list.

a. Write a static generic method, `largest(List<T> vals, Comparator<T>
compare)`, that finds the largest element in the list, using `compare`
to compare values.

b. Extend your program to find the shortest string in `strings`.  (If
there are multiple shortest strings, you can return any of them.)

c. Extend your program to find the longest string in `strings`.  (If
there are multiple longest strings, you can return any of them.)

d. Extend your program to find the string in `strings` whose sum of
ASCII values is the smallest.

e. Extend your program to find the string in `strings` whose sum of
ASCII values is the largest.

## For those with extra time

_In the unexpected situation that you find that you have extra time, you
might attempt one or more of the following exercises._

### Extra 1: Mapping

a. Implement a static generic method, `map(Function<T,R> fun, List<T>
vals)` that builds a new `ArrayList<R>` by applying `fun` to each element
of `list`.

b. Using `map`, build a new version of `strings` in which every string is converted to uppercase.

c. Using `map`, build a new version of `strings` in which the first letter in each string is converted to uppercase. 

d. Using `map`, build a new list that contains the lengths of all of the
strings in `strings`.

### Extra 2: Updates to lambda

The _Java Tutorials_ page for lambdas notes that 

> The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases.

Determine what improvements have been added in later releases.

### Extra 3: Other functional interfaces

Find at least two other functional interfaces and describe use cases
for those interfaces.

### Extra 4: Iterators

Lambda provide a nice alternative to anonymous inner classes, with
a bit less syntax.  Can we use lambda to implement iterators?  Why
or why not?
