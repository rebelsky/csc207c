You'd think the [syllabus](../syllabus) and [schedule](../schedule)
would provide all the info you need for a course, wouldn't you?  But
I've found over the years that it can be helpful to provide additional
information.  To ensure that you read the information, I even give you
[an assignment](../assignments/survey).  What else is there?  Let's see.

## Teaching, grading, and such

[On teaching and learning](teaching)
  : A bit of philosophy (more or less).

[Grading](grading)
  : More details on grading processes (and a bit on the underlying philosophy).

[Gradescope](gradescope)
  : A few notes on the grading platform we're using.

[Tokens](tokens)
  : A few notes on obtaining and using tokens.

## Other important issues

[Accommodations and adjustments](accommodations)
  : Policies and practices (and why I use two terms)

[Accessibility of Web pages](accessibility)
  : Why I try to keep pages accessible and who to report to when they're not.

[Academic integrity](academic-integrity)
  : A long document that attempts to explain key issues of academic integrity in this course and in the discipline.

[AI programming assistants](ai)
  : Some notes on why I discourage the use of AI programming assistants in my introductory classes.

[Metacognitive reflections (Pre-reflections and Post-reflection](prepost)
  : Advance warning of the questions we will ask before and after each
    mini-project and SoLA.

[Notes on taking notes](taking-notes)
  : Some notes on why you should take notes, along with some note-taking strategies.

## Java stuff

[Project setup](project-setup)
  : Instructions for setting up a new project for VSCode and Maven.

[A drop of Java style](style)
  : A few important Java style tips.

[Messages from checkstyle](checkstyle)
  : Attempts to decode the messages checkstyle gives.

## Miscellaneous

[Spam from Sam](spamr)
  : An attempt to log all the email I sent this semester.

## Other versions of the course

These also aren't strictly handouts, but I didn't have another place for them.
The list is incomplete.
