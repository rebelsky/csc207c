### Attending class remotely

_Given the illnesses going around campus, some of you may need to
attend class remotely.  That's fine, but please try not to make it
your norm._

a. Let me know via email that you will not be in class.

b. You are still responsible for the work.  Plan to do the lab on your own.

c. Synchronous: If you wish, you can join the Teams Meeting during
   class.  That gives you an opportunity to hear what I say and ask
   me questions.

d. Asynchronous: If not, I recommend that you check the recording
   and the eboard.  (You may want to check those anyway.)

e. Let me know if you need extra time on any assignments.

Debrief on Monday's lab
-----------------------

* Modern programming tools: When they work, they seem transparent.  When
  they don't work, it's often a PITA to figure out what's going wrong.
* Since we each may have different settings, what works for one person
  may not work for another.
