**You are probably being recorded, perhaps even transcribed. Of course, the technology failed in my earlier class, so perhaps not.**

_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia
* Ideas from the readings
* Questions
* Lab

Preliminaries
-------------

* I hope that VSCode and GitHub are now working better for many of you.
  I helped everyone who visited yesterday.
* I may not be in class today. If not, please behave for Elene and our sub.
* As you've probably learned, I believe in adapting the class and the
  schedule to what I observe. If you find yourself confused by a topic,
  ask and I'll usually spend time on it.
    * But don't do so just to slow down th ecourse.
* Today's distraction: Remember that GitHub and Copilot normally use
  your prompts as training data unless you stop them from doing so.
    * In GitHub, there's a "don't record" setting. It also stops
      your history. 
    * It looks like Grinnell's license with Microsoft ensures that
      Copilot does not record. Yay!
* My office hours are now posted.
