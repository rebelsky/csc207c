### Introductory notes

* Make sure that you have your github keys working!  If not, please stay
  after class and I'll work with you on it.
* Apologies for being perpetually behind.  For example, the JUnit reading
  for Monday still references Eclipse because I've been fighting with
  VSCode.
* As noted in the email, you have an extension on MP2
    * Obligatory story.

Notes and lessons from Wednesday's lab
--------------------------------------

* When you have access to source code, it's good to ask how you would
  implement something and then see how it's implemented.  (We'll try
  to remember to ask you to do this.)
* Separate interface from implementation.
    * The interface says *What*.
    * The implementation says *How*.
    * When you implement an interface in Java, you must implement all
      of the specified methods.

_You can ask questions about anything related to the class!_

### LAs

What will LAs look like for this class?

> Option one: I may ask you to do something related to the topic of 
  the day that draws upon knowledge you should already have for a
  learning outcome.  For example, when we study queues, I might ask
  "Under the PUM approach, what methods would you specify for a
  queue?  Write them down on a piece of paper."  (Note that I do
  this already; we'll just have you showing off your knowledge on
  paper.)

> Option two: I may ask you to fill out a form indicating where
  you had demonstrated mastery of something.  For example, if
  "Parsing strings" were a learning outcome, you could write "I
  demonstrated my knowledge of parsing strings on Mini-Project 2.
  Here's the relevant code."
