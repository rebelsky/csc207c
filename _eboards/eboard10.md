Notes and lessons from Wednesday's lab
--------------------------------------

* When you have access to source code, it's good to ask how you would
  implement something and then see how it's implemented.  (We'll try
  to remember to ask you to do this.)
* Separate interface from implementation.
    * When you implement an interface in Java, you must implement all
      of the specified methods.
