Lab

Reminders

* Not everyone likes to work at separate computers. Make sure your
  partner is okay with it.

Notes

* `double` vs `Double`
    * `double` is a primitive type. Four bytes, IEEE representation.
    * `Double` is an object that wraps up a `double` and provides the
      various operations we'd expect for an object, such as `toString`
      and `hashCode`.

Do not submit.
