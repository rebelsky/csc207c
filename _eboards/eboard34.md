Hash table overview
-------------------

### Key ideas 

_TPS: What are five key ideas about hash tables?_

### Hashing

_TPS: How should we compute a hash value?_

### Hash exercise

Compute your "hash code" by adding up the letters in your first name.

```
A:1     B:2     C:3     D:4     E:5     F:6     G:7     H:8     I:9
J:10    K:11    L:12    M:13    N:14    O:15    P:16    Q:17    R:18
S:19    T:20    U:21    V:22    W:23    X:24    Y:25    Z:26
```

Samuel = 19 + 1 + 13 + 21 + 5 + 12 = 71

Q: Is this a good hash function?

### Handling conflicts

_TPS: What should we do if two keys hash to the same location?_
