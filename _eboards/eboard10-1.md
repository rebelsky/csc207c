Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Notes / Etc.

_So much stuff to discuss. Feel free to ask questions as we go._ 

#### Grade reports

* Grade reports distributed Sunday night. I'll try to distribute those each
  week after I grade the SoLA.

#### Learning outcomes on lab reports

* When you fill in learning outcomes on a lab report, I'd recommend that 
  you fill them in a form that you could come back to later and review. 
  Answers like "I learned how a certain code can take different parameter 
  types" or "I learned about inheritance" doesn't let you do so.

#### Pre-assessments

* When you fill in the pre-assessment, please try to ask questions. Asking
  (good) questions is a skill that you need to develop, so practice!
* When I ask you to list resources, you should list specific resources
  (preferably with URLs), such as "the reading on inheritance" and not
  something vague like "readings".

#### General skills

* I put this in my last email, but I'll remind you again. At this point
  in the semester, you should know our core tools.
    * You should be able to compile and test code in Maven (and read output).
    * You should be able to run and test code in VSCode.
    * You should be able to debug code in VSCode, particularly failed tests.
    * You should be able to push changes to your code to GitHub.
* Why is that I keep saying "Don't use `git add .`; add the files individually",
  and you folks keep typing `git add .`?
    * This is a rhetorical question. Just don't use `git add .`.

#### Mini-projects

* Note that the primary goals of MP4 are:
    * To give you the experience of building a real data structure that
      others could use.
    * To give you more practice writing tests.
* The potential chaos of the shared testing repo is just a pleasant
  additional outcome.
* Because there were style issues in the original repo, I'm increasing the
  number of style issues permitted for M to 20 and E to 10.
* We've already had issues with the shared testing repo. I've been cleaning
  them up as we go.
    * Incorrect code was pushed (at least twice). Please make sure to
      run `mvn test` and ensure that the errors are only test errors.
    * Extra files were added (`.DS_Store`, presumably by someone who
      used `git add .`)
    * At least one test placed inappropriate restrictions on the order
      in which values are reported in `toString()`.
    * The code got reformatted.
* It's been suggested that I remind you that when you submit code to Gradescope
  from GitHub, and then update the code on GitHub, it doesn't automatically.
  get updated on Gradescope.
    * Also: GitHub submission is the preferred mechanism for Gradescope.
* I'm not sure whether I'll be here on Thursday, so I'll talk a little bit
  about MP5 today.

Questions
---------

### Questions on SoLAs

**Why does it take you so long to get SoLAs back to us?**

> It's the nature of the beast. I probably spend five minutes on
  each submission. 5 LAs x 40 submissions/LA x 5 minutes/submission
  = 600 minutes, or about ten hours. (I expect time to go down as you
  start getting used to LAs, since I can often just check "Satisfactory"
  for correct LAs.)

### Questions on MP4

_See [the assignment](../mps/mp04) for most of the Q&A. This section is here to give you the chance to ask more questions._

**I'm worried that people will push incorrect tests.**

> It's a reasonable worry. We all write incorrect tests (even me). But
  I'll be running tests against my code and will try to correct them as
  I find them.

> If you find what seems to be an incorrect test before I do, please 
  let me know.

**Do we need to write more tests than our three?**

> It's up to you, but it's not required. If you do write them, I'd
  encourage you to put them in the shared repo.

### Other administrative questions

Why do you set up a 10:30 p.m. deadline?

> To remind you that you should try to get to bed at a reasonable hour,
  particularly given that you have my class at 8:00 a.m.

When will we hear about tokens?

> Someday.

What happens when we go negative?

> You lose grades. But you can catch up by the end of the semester.

### Other questions

MP3

### New AsciiBlocks

#### Basic blocks

`Alphabetical`
  : Fill a rectangle with the alphabet.

`Chessboard`
  : Build a "chessboard" of alternating spaces and some character.

`Circle`
  : A filled circle.

`Ladder`
  : A ladder of a character side with vertical repetions.

#### Building new blocks from old

`BezierCurveStamp`
  : Another block with a Bezier curve superimposed on it.

`Borders`
  : Grabs only the "borders" of the block (first row, last row, first column,
    last column).

`Checkerboard`
  : Create a checkerboard of two blocks.

`DiagonalFlip`
  : Diagonally "flip" a block.

`DropShadow`
  : Another block with a drop shadow added.

`DShift`
  : Diagonally shift another block.

`Encrypted`
  : Another block with every character encrypted using something like 
    a Caesar cipher.

`Hollow`
  : The outer edges of another block.

`Matrice`
  : Make a matrice (matrix?) from another block.

`PatternBorder`
  : Another block surrounded by a pattern of letters

`Quartered`
  : Another block broken into four parts with lines around them.

`RandomBlock`
  : Randomizes the characters in each row of a block.

`ReplaceChar`
  : Replace all instances of one character in a Block with another one.

`Transpose`
  : Transposes the block (flips the axes).

### Ascii Art

MP5
---

_Implement a basic Assistive and Augmentive Communication Device (AAC)_

Fortunately, the UI is built already. You are building the back end.

### Goals

* Get you to think about accessibility.
* Write code that fits into a larger project (even more so than in the
  AsciiBlocks project).
* Reuse your `AssociativeArray`s.
* See a different model of project and assignment design.

### Notes

* No Maven!
* Not yet much of a testing infrastructure (hopefully forthcoming).

Questions:

**What have prior students found challenging?**

> It takes a while to understand all that's expected of you, but once
  you do, it feels surprisingly straightforward.

> You will need to add at least one method to your associative arrays,
  either `K[] getKeys()` or `String[] getKeysAsStrings()`.

> At least one method has a weird design, and in addition to returning
  a value changes the state of the system. (Probably `select`, but
  perhaps others.)

> `AACMappings` must understand that the category `""` means "go to the
  top level.

**Will we have style guidelines?**

> We will not grade you on style on this project, not least because
  Dr. Baker uses a very different style than Google Style.

> Please try to write readable code in any case.

Lab
---

The person closer to the board is Driver A. The person further from the board is Driver B.

Make sure that the name of the repo ends with `-maven`.

**Can you explain the `DecrementableCounter` example?**

> We have `Counter gamma = new DecrementableCounter(-5);`

> While we can call `gamma.increment();`, we can't call `gamma.decrement()`,
  when though we know `gamma` has a `decrement` method.

> The issue is that we've told Java that `gamma` is a `Counter`, so it
  doesn't know that it has a `decrement` method (not all `Counter` objects
  have such a method).

> The solution is to declare `gamma` as a `DecrementableCounter`.

> `DecrementableCounter gamma = new DecrementableCounter(-5);`
