**Warning** This class is being recorded.  At least I think it is.

_Approximate overview_

* Questions
* Lab

Administrivia
-------------

* Happy halfway mark!
* I've added a rubric to MP5.
* Unfortunately, I have not found time to get tokens in order.
* If you are struggling because of the conflict (or the world's varied 
  reactions to the conflict), let me know how I can help.  I'm certainly
  willing to push deadlines.
* It appears that my office hours today and tomorrow are nearly completely
  booked (completely booked today, just a little time tomorrow).  If you'd
  like to meet with me, drop me a note and we'll see what we can work out.
  (Preferred times: noon-1pm and 3:00-3:30pm today; 10:00am-noon tomorrow.

### Learning assessments

We're using the portfolio approach for learning assessments.

In the next day or two, you'll see all of the learning assessments
appear on Gradescope.  In each case, your goal is to enter some code
and some explanatory text that shows that you've mastered the
associated concept.

Testing
-------

I spent a bit of time cleaning up the `AssociativeArrayTests.java` file.
You might consider downloading the new file and seeing if I added notes
to your section.  

Some general comments:

* DO NOT PUSH NON-WORKING CODE!  To get it working, I had to add semicolons 
  and more.
* DO NOT RELY ON ACCESS TO PRIVATE/PACKAGE FIELDS!  Given the "approved"
  position of the tests, it shouldn't be possible to access `pairs` or
  `size` or such.
* IF YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR TESTS, BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY ARE CORRECT.
  We all make mistakes.  But your mistakes shouldn't cause others stress.
* DO NOT RELY ON PARTICULAR IMPLEMENTATIONS!  Many of you wrote tests
  that made assumptions about how people expanded arrays, what order
  elements showed up in the underlying array, and such.
* IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUSH TO THE COMMON REPO, ASK A QUESTION.

But Sam, how do I test `toString`?

> Consider the case in which we've added A:1, B:2, and C:3 to our
  dictionary.

> We should write a test that checks whether the dictionary is one
  of "{ A: 1, B: 2, C: 3 }", "{ A: 1, C: 2, B: 3 }", "{ B: 2, A: 1, C: 3 }",
  "{ B: 2, C: 3, A: 1 }", "{ C: 3, A: 2, B: 2 }", or "{ C: 3, B: 2, A: 1 }".

        @Test
        public void testToString() {
          AssociativeArray<String,Integer> si = 
            new AssociativeArray<String,Integer.();
          si.set("A",1);
          si.set("B",2);
          si.set("C",3);
          String result = si.toString();
          assertTrue(result.equals("{ A: 1, B: 2, C: 3 }") ||
              result.equals("{ A: 1, C: 3, B: 2 }") ||
              result.equals("{ B: 2, A: 1, C: 3 }") ||
              result.equals("{ B: 2, C: 3, A: 1 }") ||
              result.equals("{ C: 3, A: 1, B: 2 }") ||
              result.equals("{ C: 3, B: 2, A: 1 }"));
        } // testToString()

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Java

Why do we use iterators?

>

What's an `enum`?

>

### MP5

_There are some new questions and answers at the end of the miniproject.

AACCategory seems a whole lot like our AssociativeArray.  What's different?

> In many ways, `AACCategory` is just an adapter for our `AssociativeArray`
  class.  We can often write our methods as calls to underlying methods
  in `AssociativeArray`.

> But we will probably have to write a `K[] keys` method in `AssociativeArray`.
