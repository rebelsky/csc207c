Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Readings

**Can you explain a bit more about iterators?**

> You'll get more accustomed to iterators as we go. But, in essence,
  an iterator gives you access to the elements of a collection one
  value at a time.

> We have [a reading on iterators](../readings/iterators) for the next
  class period.

### Miscellaneous

**I don't understand what super() and when it should be used.**

> `super()` is generally a call to the constructor of the superclass.
  (`super.X is how you refer to most things in the superclass). You
  can only call the superclass constructor as the first line of your
  constructor; if you don't Java automatically calls the zero-ary
  constructor of the parent.
