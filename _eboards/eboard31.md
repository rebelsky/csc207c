Administrivia
-------------

* FYI: There are only two MPs left; I don't think we should have work
  due on Thanksgiving (week 12) or during week 14.
* You can use week 14 and finals week to catch up on MP redos and
  to LAs.
* Please return cards, boards, and markers to the back of the room
  when you finish class today.

Will we have two redo opportunities for each mini-project?

> I hope so.

Binary Search Trees
-------------------

What do you know about binary search trees?

* They are trees.
* In which each node has 0, 1, or 2 children ("binary")
* You use them to search
* The connections are from parents to children, but not across siblings.
* In many implementations, we terminate with null values.
* How do we arrange a BST to make searching easier?  
    * Bad strategy: No particular arrangement, requires searching
      both halves.
    * Good strategy: Put smaller elements on the left and larger
      elements on the right.  (We normally don't permit duplicates.)
* How do you search a BST?
    * Look at the current node.  If the element in the node matches
      the sought value, you're done
    * Otherwise, if the element in the node is larger than the sought
      value, search in the left subtree
    * Otherwise, we know the element in the node is smaller than the
      sought value, so search in the right subtree.
    * When you run off the tree, you know the element is not there.
* Running time to search a tree of $n$ nodes?  (Big O.)
    * $O(logn)$, in an ideal (balanced) binary tree.
    * $O(n)$, if we arrange the tree badly
    * $O(depth)$
* BSTs encode binary search in the data structure, which *should* make
  it possible to have a structure we can extend while still searching
  efficiently.
* What makes trees efficient?  A balanced/complete tree of $n values 
  has height $logn$, so if we can build such a tree and only need to
  look at one value per level, we generally get $O(logn)$ algorithms.

Detours

* What are the key ideas in quicksort?
    * There's a pivot (ideally, the median, but usually some random
      value)
    * We divide our values into those smaller than the pivot and larger
      than the pivot.
    * We recursively sort both halves.

Draw a BST for the following strings: 

* koala, llama, gnu, hippo, aardvark, monkey, baboon, chinchilla, dingo
