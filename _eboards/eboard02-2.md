**You are probably being recorded** (and transcribed) (if the technology is working correctly).
    * Otter.ai now times out after ninety minutes, so I may pause after an
      hour to start a second recording.
    * My otter.ai monthly limit has been cut, so I'll do my best to stop
      recording during lab. Hopefully, I'll remember to turn it on for
      announcements. (That probably makes it more convenient, too.)
    * If you talk to me after class, please ensure that I've stopped recording.

_Start of class instructions_

* Optional: Grab a mask
* Grab one of the business cards on the table that have computer names 
  and locations.
* Identify where the corresponding computer is.
* Return the card to the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* The first person at the computer logs in.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.
    * Recommended: Discuss working strengths and areas to improve

_Approximate overview_

* Preliminaries
    * Notes and news
    * Upcoming work
    * Tokens
* Questions
* Lab one: Getting started with Java
* Lab two: Getting strated with Maven (take-home)

Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* No attendance today, but please say your name when answering or asking
  questions.
    * I'll also walk around and check people off.
* Please do the Maven lab on your own (with help as necessary). There is
  nothing to turn in.
* My wife has taken a turn for the worse, so I will only be on campus
  for my classes (and a few other appointments). I'd prefer asynchronous
  conversations to synchronous, but will set up synchronous appointments
  by request. (Email me or DM me for those requests.)

### Upcoming work

* Readings due Wednesday night
    * [An introduction to Git](../readings/git)
    * [An introduction to GitHub](../readings/github)
    * [An introduction to VSCode](../readings/vscode)
    * [Getting started with Visual Studio Code (video)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
* Optional: Submit [reading questions for class 3](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/818402/assignments/4871387/) by 10:30 pm on Wednesday
* Finish the [Getting started with Java lab](../labs/getting-started)
  through "find the minimum in an array". (Nothing to turn in beyond what
  you did in class.)
* Do the [Maven lab](../labs/maven). (Nothing to turn in beyond what you
  did in class.)
* Mini-project 1 to be distributed on Thursday.

Questions
---------

Why are you making us create `PrintWriter` objects rather than using 
`System.out`?

> 

What if I want to print debugging output?

> 

Could you explain more about `static` keyword in java? In the reading, it says (`static` indicates that the method can run without having an associated object created),, but I don't quite understand.

> 

Could you make the `for(String name: names)` thing more clearer because I don't know exactly what name or names represent or String. For example, if String is just where the type goes then just clarify that it is the where the type of the array goes and the same for the rest.

> 

How do Maven and other build tools (like Gradle or Ant) compare in terms of features and ease of use?

> I have no idea.

Is a class interchangeable with a file? In other words, can one file only contain one class?

>

In the input and output section where you were making an object of class PrintWriter, how did you know the parameters of that class? 

> 

Is there a difference between import in Java and #include in C?

> 

Could you explain the difference between ADTs and Data Structures in a less abstract way? I'm still a bit confused about that. 

> Not today.

Why we put `static` on the main class?

> 

Please explain why we need to use 'new' in Java. What's the functionality?

> Wait until next Tuesday.

Can we use VSCode to edit files?

> Sure. I had assumed that CSC-161 was still using Emacs, but I've since
  learned otherwise.

Lab: Getting Started with Java
------------------------------

The person closer to the screen is partner A. The person further from the 
screen is partner B.

### Questions

What folder should I use?

> I'd suggest something like `/home/USERNAME/CSC207/Labs/getting-started`.

Wrapping up ...

* Make a zip file (see instructions).
* Upload your zip file to Gradescope.

Lab: Getting Started with Maven
-------------------------------

Please finish the prior lab up to the `min(int[] arr)` problem (on your own
or with your partner or with anyone).

Please do this one on your own (or with your partner or with anyone). There
is nothing to turn in; this is a "practice to understand" lab.

Side note: Tab is your friend.
