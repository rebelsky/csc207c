Administrivia
-------------

* Welcome back!  I hope you had wonderful breaks and that you are not broken.
* Yay!  Class 23 is on the 23rd.  I'm not sure what that signifies, but I'm
  somehow pleased.

Questions
---------

The problem of sorting
----------------------

### Basics

_What does it mean to sort?_

### Validation, conceptual

_How do you now if you've succeeded? (in English)_

### Validation, problematic

_How do you now if you've succeeded? (in English)_

### Design

_What approaches do we have to design sorting algorithms?_

### Issues

_What restrictions might we put on a sorting algorithm?_

Testing sorting algorithms
--------------------------

_What kinds of tests can you run to ensure that your sorting algorithm works correctly?_

Insertion sort
--------------

Selection sort
--------------

Detour: The Dutch National Flag problem
---------------------------------------

You have an array with three values, which weâ€™ll call red, white,
and blue. They are in no particular order. Your goal is to rearrange
it so that all of the red are at the left, all the blue are at the
right, and all the white are in between.  

_You may not simply count the values; different reds represent different
objects (similarly for blues and whites)._

Sample input:

```
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Ba | Rb | Wc | Wd | Re | Bf | Wg | Rh | Wi | Wj | Wk | Rl | Wm | Bn | Bo | Wp | Rq |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```
