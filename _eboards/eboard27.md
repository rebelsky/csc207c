_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia 
* Lab

Preliminaries
-------------

* Thanks to whoever told our mentor to tell me that I'm not giving you 
  enough time for lab. 
    * Note that Wednesday was intentionally a "let's figure out
      list iterators" day (based on my experiences last semester).
      We'll still have time for that lab on Monday.
* Note: Class is "virtual" on Monday. You should do the lab on your own
  (with or without a partner), checking in with me if/when you need help.
* We understand lists best when we diagram them. Consider grabbing a
  whiteboard and marker.
