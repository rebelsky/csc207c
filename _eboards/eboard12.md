Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Today's lab is somewhat rewritten.  Fingers crossed that everything works
  okay.
    * Make sure that you are using the repo named something like
      `lab-exceptions-vscode`.
* Note that you can usually get VSCode to format your code to meet my
  expectations using the command "Format Document".
* Your graders ask that you not clog your repositories with cruft.
    * Just the README and the .java files *for the specific project*.

Questions
---------

_You can ask questions about anything related to the class!  Self gov
says that you **should** ask those questions._

### Java

### Administrative stuff

Do we get to choose which way I meet each LA?

> If I have a paper-based LA, then you should at least try the first
  time on paper.  If that fails, you can provide me with evidence.

### MP2

### MP3

What should I get if I center boxed text?

> It depends on the particulars.  Let's say you build
  `new Centered(new BoxedBlock(new TextLine("Hello")), 21)`
  and put it above `new TextLine("012345678901234567890123456789")`.`

              +-----+
              |Hello|
              +-----+
       012345678901234567890123456789

> On the other hand, if you built a block with an expression like
  `new BoxedBlock(new Centered(new TextLine("Hello"), 21))`, that should
  look more like

       +---------------------+
       |        Hello        |
       +---------------------+
       012345678901234567890123456789

> Order of operations matters!
