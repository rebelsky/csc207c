Questions
---------

When will the LAs start appearing?

> Monday. Thanks for the reminder.

How do we do an LA?

> Respond with some combination of explanation and code. You are choosing
  and providing evidence that you have mastered the learning objective.

> You'll probably end up with about a week.

Are LAs timed?

> No. But they do have a due date/time, so I suppose that's one kind of
  time limit.

How long should an LA take?

> If you've really mastered the material, I would hope that it would
  take you about fifteen minutes to do most LAs.

Wow! Only twelve hours to do all the LAs if I get them right the first
time. Thank you Sam!

> You're welcome.

### Working with packages in VSCode

Note: When you are in VSCode, you should be opening/working with the folder 
that contains the `src` directory.

### Using `git`

Note: Here's the traditional `git push` sequence.

    git add FILE
    git commit FILE -m "commit message"
    git pull
    # Deal with merge errors (hopefully none)
    git push

View -> Source Control lets you use a UI to do the Git stuff.

### NaN

Not a number

### Primary things you learned?

* We got practice testing.
* `assertEquals` expects three parameters when you're comparing doubles.
  (The third parameter is "epsilon", how close the two results should be.)
* `Math.sqrt` does not throw an exception if given a negative parameter.
* You need to say that your code is throwing an exception.
* Adding `throws Exception` in one place may break code elsewhere.
    * You should think about exceptions early in your design.
