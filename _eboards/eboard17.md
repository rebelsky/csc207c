_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia
* Questions
* Lab

Preliminaries
-------------

* I've revised my target for returning the first set of LAs.
* There is no reading for Friday.
* Those of you planning to declare CS majors should make sure to fill
  out the form by 5pm today. 
    * If you don't fill out the form, you won't get an advisor. 
    * If you don't get an advisor, you won't be able to declare a CS major.
    * If you don't declare a CS major, you probably won't be able to take
      any more CS classes.

### New LAs

* I've released a bunch of new LAs as well as opportunities for
  redos of the prior LAs. (I realize you may not get the originals
  in time to redo. However, not all of you submitted them in the
  first go-round.)
* One LA is not like the others. This one asks you to do something new.
  But you have from now until Friday to do it.

### New MP

* Borrowed from elsewhere and then updated.
* We'll look at it.
