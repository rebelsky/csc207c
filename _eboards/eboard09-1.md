Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* I'm still here. I'm unsure about whether I'll be here on Tuesday.
* Some time today, you should receive an invitation to join a testing repository
  on GitHub. Please make sure to accept that invitation.

### Struggles

Comment from student: "I feel like I'm struggling."

* Many of you are. It's the nature of the beast. Semi-(un)cooperative tools
  and a (fill-in-adjective) professor don't help.
* Survey!
    * I feel like I'm struggling a lot in 207 [ ]
    * I feel like I'm struggling a bit in 207 [ ]
    * I don't feel like I'm struggling in 207 [ ]
* I worry that folks aren't asking enough questions. You really shouldn't
  spend more than five or ten minutes stuck on a problem before you reach
  out for help.
    * For example, I hear many people had difficulty with "the parameters
      can appear in (almost) any order on MP1". Yet I received no questions
      on that issue.

* TLA:

### The ADT (SAM)

_We are designing an ADT similar to the association lists or hashes that you may have learned in CSC-151._

#### Strategy

Generalize arrays so that we can use "any" object as a key, rather than just integers.

Questions
---------

### Qustions on SoLAs

**Will you add tips for each LA so that we don't go in the wrong direction?**

> Part of the broader goal of the course is that you develop skills at
  figuring out how to describe your skills.

> But yes, I will try to add tips. I may also add some verbally in class
  (or ask you to come up with some).

### Questions on MPs

**I'm spending significantly more than five hours on mini-projects. Any suggestions?**

> Ask for help (preferably on the Questions channel) after you're stuck for
  five minutes. Generally, if you can't solve it in five minutes, you also
  won't solve it in thirty minutes.

**Will the redos for the mini-projects be posted soon?**

> Yes.

**How many group mini-projects will there be?**

> Probably between three and four.

**Do both partners need to turn in a token for a late group mini-project?**

> Yes.

### Other administrative questions

**Will we get grade reports soon?**

> Yes. Probably this weekend.

That is, the name should end with `-maven`.
