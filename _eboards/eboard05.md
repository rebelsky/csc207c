**Warning** This class is being recorded.

_Getting started_ (this will be our normal start-of-class sequence)

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first, start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

### Leftover questions

Why can't I get Java to work on my laptop?

> That's a great question.  Did you try downloading the "complete VSCode package"
  from <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial>?

> You can always work in MathLAN.  There are people here to share your suffering.

I'm confused about Git.

> I hope that today's lab will help.  If not, let's chat.

What's the difference between Git and GitHub?

> Git is collaborative version control software.  You can use it to store
  versions of your software in various locations, including your local
  disk.  GitHub is one of the more popular hosting services for Git
  repositories.  (GitHub also provides software that you can use to
  create your own hosting service.)

Java is weird.

> It will feel less weird the more you get used to it.  Ask questions!  Accept
  that some things will be weird.
