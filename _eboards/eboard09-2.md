Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* I'm still here. I'm unsure about whether I'll be here on Tuesday.
* Some time today, you should receive an invitation to join a testing 
  repository on GitHub. Please make sure to accept that invitation.
* If I don't respond to email within 24 hours, it's probably lost in
  my mailbox. Email again.
    * Similar for DM.

### Struggles

Comment from student: "I feel like I'm struggling."

* Many of you are. It's the nature of the beast. Semi-(un)cooperative tools
  and a (fill-in-adjective) professor don't help.
* Survey!
    * I feel like I'm struggling a lot in 207 [ ]
    * I feel like I'm struggling a bit in 207 [ ]
    * I don't feel like I'm struggling in 207 [ ]
* I worry that folks aren't asking enough questions. You really shouldn't
  spend more than five or ten minutes stuck on a problem before you reach
  out for help.
    * For example, I hear many people had difficulty with "the parameters
      can appear in (almost) any order on MP1". Yet I received no questions
      on that issue.

Mini-project 4
--------------

TLAs

* ADT: 
* SAM: 
* AAA: 
* TLA: 

### The ADT (SAM), which we'll call "Dictionary"

_We are designing an ADT similar to the association lists or hashes that you may have learned in CSC-151._

#### Strategy

Generalize arrays so that we can use "any" comparable object as a key,
rather than just integers.

#### A

#### Methods 

### More methods (from the assignment)

#### Notes

* Dictionaries are also called "Tables", "Maps", "Hashes" (even though they
  aren't always implemented as hashes), and some other things.

### The data structure (AAA): Associative Arrays

#### A

_See whiteboard or assignment._

#### A

`get` - 

`set` - 

`set` - 

`hasKey` -

`remove` -

#### Analysis

If there are `n` k/v pairs in the array, how many do we have to look at
to do each of the following? ("About `n`" or "the same number each time")

`get` - 

`set` - 

`hasKey` - 

`remove` - 

#### Notes

### The assignment

See [the assignment](../mps/mp04) and [the repo]().

### Testing

Write tests early. Pull other tests. Tell me when you add tests.

### Questions

**Will we have merge conflicts?**

> I hope not. But part of the point is to get you used to working on a
  large collaborative repository.

Questions
---------

### Questions on SoLAs

**Will you add tips for each LA so that we don't go in the wrong direction?**

> Part of the broader goal of the course is that you develop skills at
  figuring out how to describe your skills.

> But yes, I will try to add tips. I may also add some verbally in class
  (or ask you to come up with some).

**If we are just having a reading in composition, why do we have
to answer an LA on that?**

> Because you've been dealing with the more basic form of composition
  since you started writing objects, and the LA only asks you to
  explore the more basic form of composition.

> Also: You don't _have to_ answer tha LA. You can hold off another week
  or more.

### Questions on MPs

**I'm spending significantly more than five hours on mini-projects. Any
suggestions?**

> Ask for help (preferably on the Questions channel) after you're stuck for
  five minutes. Generally, if you can't solve it in five minutes, you also
  won't solve it in thirty minutes.

**Will the redos for the mini-projects be posted soon?**

> Yes.

**How many group mini-projects will there be?**

> Probably between three and four.

**Do both partners need to turn in a token for a late group mini-project?**

> Yes.

### Other administrative questions

**Will we get grade reports soon?**

> Yes. Probably this weekend.

### Questions on MP3

**What is a "good commit"?**

> It has a good description.

> It's not "I committed everything".

> Smaller is better.

**Does it count if the commit is on a branch?**

> Yes.

**We couldn't push and pull. Why?**

> Next time, send me the message.

> If someone has changed the repo, you'll need to pull before you push.

> When you pull, you may get merge conflicts. If you do, read through
  the file that has the merge conflicts, choose which code to keep, 
  add and commit.

### Questions on the readings

**Is the way inheritance works similar to the way that pointers do?**

> Inheritance requires pointers (or "references") behind the scenes,
  but it's more the concept that you automatically delegate method
  calls to the parent class, which I'd say is independent of pointers.

**What should I do if I want to inherit from three classes, ex
SmileStudentTeacherChef? (I felt composition + inheritence could
only deal with 2 parent classes.)**

> Use composition. Composition can handle an arbitrary number of
  delegated classes. It's just a bit more work on your end.

### Other questions

MP4 Setup
---------

Please follow the setup instructions for MP4.
