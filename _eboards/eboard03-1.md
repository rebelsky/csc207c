**You are probably being recorded** (and transcribed) (if the technology is working correctly).
    * Otter.ai now times out after ninety minutes, so I may pause after an
      hour to start a second recording.
    * My otter.ai monthly limit has been cut, so I'll do my best to stop
      recording during lab. Hopefully, I'll remember to turn it on for
      announcements. (That probably makes it more convenient, too.)
    * If you talk to me after class, please ensure that I've stopped recording.
