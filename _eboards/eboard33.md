How would you set up the node classes in Bit Trees?

> Option one (preferred): A `BitTreeNode` interface and separate
  `BitTreeInteriorNode` and `BitTreeLeaf` classes that implement it.
  Here's a sketch

        interface BitTreeNode {
          public boolean isLeaf();
        } // interface BitTreeNode

        class BitTreeInteriorNode {
          BitTreeNode left;
          BitTreeNode right;

          public boolean isLeaf() {
            return false;
          } // isLeaf

        } // class BitTreeInteriorNode

        class BitTreeLeaf {
          String contents;

          public boolean isLeaf() {
            return true;
          } // isLeaf()

        } // class BitTreeLeaf

> Option two: Put the left, right, and contents fields in one class,
  and just skip them in the parts that aren't necessary.
