Questions

### Questions on SoLAs

**Will we have time limits on any LAs?**

> Nope. I hope that you can complete most LAs in under fifteen minutes.
  The model in most cases is that you should (a) check your
  notes/code/memory for something you've written, (b) find that thing,
  (c) copy/paste/edit, and (d) spend a few minutes adding narrative.
