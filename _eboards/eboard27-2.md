Questions
---------

### Administrative

**I've missed way too many readings / labs / metas. What do I do?**

> Let's chat.

**The reports are missing the most recent labs, readings, and metas, right?**

> Yes.

**Can I assume that if I turned in a lab, reading, and/or meta, I'm getting
  a satisfactory for it?**

> Almost certinaly.

**Can I turn in third redos even if I don't turn in the second redo?**

> Of course.

**Do third redos cost tokens?**

> Yes. All redos after the first cost tokens. However, you have infinte
  tokens.

**So the only thing that will affect my grade based on LAs and MPs
  are the missing labs, readings, and metas?**

> Yes.

**How many LAs are there?**

> I thought there were 47. Whoops. There are 49. Since I miscounted, 
  I'm not increasing the LA requirements for each grade. (You should, 
  of course, all strive for 49.)

**How do I make an appointment with you?**

> Suggest a time on Outlook scheduler.

> Email me to see when I'm available.

> Talk to me after class.

**Will SoLA 12 be graded before SoLA 13?**

> Yes.

**If I have something ungraded from an old SoLA, what should I do?**

> Let me know. I didn't think I missed anything.

**I don't remember implementing priority queues. What should I do on
  the LA?**

> It's fine if you summarize a design you made.

### Graphs

**Does it matter where we start in Prim's algorithm?**

> Nope. It works with any starting vertex.

**When is Kruskalâ€™s better than Prim's, or the other way around?**

> Whichever we can more easily implement is better.  (Alternately, 
  whichever of our implementations generally runs faster is better.)

> I find Prim's easier to implement, since we need more structures
  to check for cycles.

**Can you explain more of what's meant by weighted and unweighted/directed
and undirected?**

> Weighted: Each edge has a weight which represents the "cost" of following
  that edge.

> Unweighted: No weight on edges (all are the same).

> Directed: Edgs are "one-way" (like one-way streets).

> Undirected: Edges are two-way.

**Maybe give more visual examples to help explain, for instance, the
minimum spanning tree?**

> Yes.

**Do these algorithms work with all values, zero or greater, or only 
  positive values?**

> Zero or greater. We generally require that the graph have only non-negative 
  values to find an MST.

> You can always convert a graph with negative edges to one with nonnegative
  edges by adding the inverse of the smallest value.

Basic algorithm?

Greed as a design strategy
--------------------------

Implementing Prim's MST Algorithm
---------------------------------

```text
Pick a random vertex
Add all of the edges from that vertex to REMAINING
While edges remain
  Grab the remaining edge with the lowest weight
  If either vertex is not in the minimum-spanning tree
    Add the edge to MST
    Add all the edges from that vertex to REMAINING
      (arguably, you should only add those that don't lead back to the MST)
```

_TPS_

Assume that you have full access to the `Graph` class that I provided (e.g., that you can even look at the internals).

a. How can we tell if a vertex is in the MST?

b. Prim's requires undirected graphs. How will you accommodate that issue?

c. How will you represent the MST?

d. How will you pick a random starting vertex?

e. How will you grab the remaining edge with lowest weight?

f. How will you print out the MST?

Lab

Do the Dijkstra's lab first.  If you happen to finish, try the MST lab.
