Administrivia
-------------

* Please work with your mini-project 9 partner(s) on this lab.
* Please return cards, boards, and markers to the back of the room
  when you finish class today.
* In case you don't read email: I will not penalize you for missing
  or late assessments as long as you do the two MP9 assessmens.
    * Assessments are generally for your benefit, not mine.
* Wednesday's class will be a "recitation day"; that is, we'll develop
  a data structure together.  Lots of opportunities for TPS.
* I'm hoping to limit the pre-lab stuff today so that you have lots
  of time for labs.
* MP6 (sorting) returned

### Other good things (no tokens)

### Some notes from MP6

* Please follow style guidelines and/or reformat.
    * Space after `if`, `while`, etc.
    * Space before open braces.
    * Ugh: `if(x==1){...}`
    * Better : `if (x==1) {...}`
    * Two-space indent.
* I have no idea why so many of you think that it's a good idea to
  put comments on the side.  DON'T.  Comments generally belong above 
  the code they describe.
        x = 2;                          // Assign 2 to x
* Sam likes you to comment right braces.
          } // if
        } // for
* Please use the starter code.
* I was surprised that so few of you used an explicit `insert`
  in `InsertionSort.sort`.
* Please don't repeat helper methods like `swap`.
* Please commit more regularly.
* Many of you worked with other people on labs related to the MP, but
  did not seem to cite them.
* Please try to limit your lines to fewer than 80 characters.

Wow, you're harsh.  You gave me an I because I didn't put my name on
