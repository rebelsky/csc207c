**You are probably being recorded (and transcribed)**  [at least if Sam can get the technology working again]

_Start of class instructions_

* Optional: Grab a mask
* Grab one of the business cards on the table that have computer names 
  and locations.
* Identify where the corresponding computer is.
* Return the card to the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* The first person at the computer logs in (and, if appropriate, forks
  and clones the repo).
* Grab a piece of paper (one per pair should be enough).
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.
    * Recommended: Discuss working strengths and areas to improve

Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* Writing MP3 took me far more time than it should have. I did not have
  time to do anything else yesterday. (Other than personal stuff.) In
  particular, I did not review all of your questions for class.
* I am not sure whether or not I'll be here next week. If not, you'll have
  awesome subs.
* I've tried to rearrange the upcoming work section for clarity. Let me
  know if you have problems with it.
* Only one more week of Java and OOP. Then we (mostly) move on to data
  structures and algorithms!

About MP3
---------

Like the second half of Tuesday's lab, but extended! Also partnered.
Today's lab partner is your MP partner. If you are not here today, 
Sam will assign you a partner.

I will reserve ten minutes at the end of class today for you to make
plans with your partner (e.g., meeting times).

Notes from Tuesday's lab
------------------------

### "It looks right" vs. "I'm confident that it's right"

The point of the horizontal composition exercise.

Also "What should be the meaning?"

### Code that could be improved

I am stunned to see how many of you wrote the following for row 0 of
the surrounded box.

```
    public String row(int i) {
      if (i == 0) {
        return boxChar + boxChar.repeat(contents.width()) + boxChar;
      } else {
        ...
      } // if/else
    } // row(int)
```

_Why would this disturb me?_ (TPS)

Questions
---------

### Questions on SoLAs

**Will we have time limits on any LAs?**

> Nope. I hope that you can complete most LAs in about twenty minutes
  The model in most cases is that you should (a) check your
  notes/code/memory for something you've written, (b) find that thing,
  (c) copy/paste/edit, and (d) spend a few minutes adding narrative.

### Questions on MP2

**Can I use my code from the lab in which we worked with `BigFraction`?**

> Certainly. But cite your partner.

### Questions on the Reading

_Model: Read over these. Start the lab. At some point, I'll ask if
anyone has questions._

**Can you give examples/situations in which one type of polymorphism
is better over the other?**

> We tend to use parametric polymorphism when we want to build a
  new data type that can hold/work with "any type of object" (or
  perhaps some restricted types of objects).  E.g., "I want a
  homogeneous list."

> We tend to use subtype polymorphism when we want to write methods
  that work with a restricted class of object. E.g., "I can do
  this calculation with anything that acts like a number."

**Does the letter used matter when creating a generic interface that
takes multiple type parameters? In the example, T and U were used,
implying that one would continue adding type parameters named V,
W, X, etc., though the java.util.function.Function documentation
used R and V as type parameters. Is there any correlation or
importance to these?**

> You can use whatever letters you want. (You may even be able to use
  words, but no one seems to do so).

> I thought Function uses `T` and `R`. `T` is used because it stands
  for "type". `R` stands for `Result`.

**Is it possible to specify a type within a type specification (For example,
`DynamicArray<DynamicArray<String>>` to make a jagged 2D array of strings)?**

> Yes.

### Questions I'll try to answer later

Could we dive deeper into type safety with generics and how to
handle runtime exceptions related to generics?

Can you explain more about wildcard types (? super T, ? extends T)
and when they are useful in practice?

How do generics in Java compare to mechanisms similar to those in
other programming languages, such as C++ templates?
