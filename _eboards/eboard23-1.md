Notes on MP10
-------------

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### MP9

### MP10

### Miscellaneous

Hash table overview
-------------------

### Key ideas 

_TPS: What are five key ideas about hash tables?_

### Hashing

_TPS: How should we compute a hash value?_

Hash exercise
-------------

### Hash exercise

Compute your "hash code" by adding up the letters in your first name.

```
A:1     B:2     C:3     D:4     E:5     F:6     G:7     H:8     I:9
J:10    K:11    L:12    M:13    N:14    O:15    P:16    Q:17    R:18
S:19    T:20    U:21    V:22    W:23    X:24    Y:25    Z:26
```

For example,

* Samuel -> 19 + 1 + 13 + 21 + 5 + 12 = 71

We will put your names into the hash table on the board.

_TPS: What did we discover?_

Lab

If there is time, we will conduct lab. We will continue the lab in the next class.
