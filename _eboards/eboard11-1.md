### Other good things (no tokens)

Questions
---------

### Administrative

**It looks like mini-project 7 is assigned before fall break and due
  after fall break. That makes it look like you want us to do work over
  fall break. Do we really have to?**

> The intention was that you would mostly do mini-project 7 after you
  got back from fall break. However, I understand that the model adds
  a bit of a burden. So I'll drop MP7 and renumber.
