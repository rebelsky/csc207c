Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Notes / Etc.

* We have both talking and lab(s) today. 
* There are two labs; it's okay if you don't do much of the second one.
* Please fill out mentor evaluation forms.
* Note that "lower-bound inclusive, upper-bound exclusive" is a common
  approach.  Think about, say, `String.substring(lb, ub)`. I strongly
  ecnourage you to use it.
    * Reason one: `length = ub - lb`.
    * Reason two: `String.substring(lb, mid) + ", " + String.substring(mid, ub)`
* I've added a three-day extension for MP9. It's now due on Sunday to
  give you another weekend.
* Grading updates
    * MPs/A: Was 5E, 5M, 1R, now 4E, 5M, 2R
    * MPs/B: Was 3E, 6M, 2R, now 2E, 5M, 3R
    * MPs/C: Was 2E, 5M, 4R, now 1E, 5M, 5R
    * MPs/D: Remains 4M, 5R, 2I
    * LAs/A: Was 46/48, now 45/48
    * LAs/B: Was 44/48, now 43/48
    * LAs/C: Was 42/48, now 41/48

### Other good things (no tokens)

Notes on MP9
------------

* Goals of assignment
    * Build something like a linked list
    * Build iterators for the structure
    * In a non-trivial context
    * Read and understand documentation for library classes
    * More collaboration
* Due date extended until Sunday (with late assignments accepted until Tuesday).
* These hashes are not the same as the hash values/hash codes we use for 
  hash tables.
    * The also aren't the same as hash tables.
    * These hashes are values we compute so that we can validate
      data in the future. If we compute a hash now and compute a hash
      later, the two hashes should be the same. (Hashes are generally
      smaller than the data.)
* Note that you should do the mining primarily in the first `Block`
  constructor. The `mine` operation in blockchains just calls that
  constructor and then returns the nonce of the created block.

Applying the ACM Code of Ethics
-------------------------------

_Modified from <https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-malware-disruption/>.  Please don't read the analysis._

Responsible Services advertised its web hosting services as “cheap, guaranteed uptime, no matter what.” While some of Responsible’s clients were independent web-based retailers, the majority were focused on malware and spam. Several botnets used Responsible’s reliability guarantees to protect their command-and-control servers from take-down attempts. Spam and other fraudulent services leveraged Responsible for continuous delivery. Corrupted advertisements often linked to code hosted on Responsible to exploit browser vulnerabilities to infect machines with ransomware.

Despite repeated requests from major ISPs and international organizations, Responsible refused to intervene with these services, citing their “no matter what” pledge to their customers. Furthermore, international pressure from other governments failed to induce national-level intervention, as Responsible was based in a country whose laws did not adequately proscribe such hosting activities.

Ultimately, Responsible was forcibly taken offline through a coordinated effort from multiple security vendors working with several government organizations. This effort consisted of a targeted worm that spread through Responsible’s network. This denial-of-service attack successfully took Responsible’s machines offline, destroying much of the data stored with the ISP in the process. All of Responsible’s clients were affected. No other ISPs reported any impact from the worm, as it included mechanisms to limit its spread. As a result of this action, spam and botnet traffic immediately dropped significantly. In addition, new infections of several forms of ransomware ceased.

_TPS: Was the response appropriate?  Ethical?  What principles would permit the security vendors and government organizations to write such software._

Designing a Dictionary (Map) ADT
--------------------------------

Strategy: 

* A generalized way to create a collection in which you can look up values
  by their corresponding keys.
* "Arrays with homogeneous keys of types other than integer".

Applications:

* Keep track of deposits in a block chain.
* Keep track of the relationship between images and words that those
  images represent.
* Keep track of student grades.
* Find all the events on a certain date.

Methods: (tps)

```java
public interface Map<K, V> {
} // interface Map<K, V>
```

Implementing the Dictionary (MAP) ADT
-------------------------------------

Arrangements

* Associative Array: An array of key/value pairs.
* Association List: A list of key/value pairs.
* Sorted array of K/V pairs. (Make searching faster.)
* Sorted list of K/V pairs. (Easier to iterate in order.)
* Binary search tree: A tree in which smaller keys fall to the left
  and larger keys fall to the right. (This holds at every node.)
* Hash table: Forthcoming.

Binary search trees
-------------------

Let $$n$$ be the number of elements in the tree and $$h$$ be the height of the tree.

Relationship between $$h$$ and $$n$$?
