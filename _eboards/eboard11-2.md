Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Notes / Etc.

* _We have a substitute today. I anticipate that we will continue to have 
  substitutes for the near future._
* I returned half of SoLA 3 last night. I anticipate returning the other
  half relatively soon.
* Two important notes on SoLAs:
    * It's okay if you're missing LAs. Most people miss multiple LAs the
      first time they try them. They recover in the end. It takes practice
      to identify meaningful code and write about it.
    * It's free to redo LAs. That is, I don't charge tokens. That's
      intentional.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

**It looks like mini-project 7 is assigned before fall break and due
  after fall break. That makes it look like you want us to do work over
  fall break. Do we really have to?**

> The intention was that you would mostly do mini-project 7 after you
  got back from fall break. However, I understand that the model adds
  a bit of a burden. So I'll drop MP7 and renumber.
