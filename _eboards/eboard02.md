**Warning** This class is being recorded.

_Getting started_ (this will be our normal start-of-class sequence)

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first, start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

_Approximate overview_

* Administrative stuff [10--15 min]
* Questions on readings.
