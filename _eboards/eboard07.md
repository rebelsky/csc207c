Mental models
-------------

To understand how our code works (and why it doesn't work), it can be
helpful to form _mental models_ of how the computer stores and processes
our programs.

* In CSC-151, we generally used a _substitutive model_ which broke down
  slightly once we hit procedures with side effects.
    * Subtitution also gets more complicated when you reuse names
      in `let` bindings.
* Our model will be somewhat different for Java, not least because
  Java is explicitly stateful.
* Our model need not precisely mimic what the Java Virtual Machine does;
  rather, our goal is to understand conceptually what it does.
* To model the Java, we need to consider classes, objects, and
  inheritance (which we haven't covered yet).

Classes
-------

TPS: What information should we store for each class?

Objects
-------

TPS: What information should we store for each object?

Compile-time and Runtime issues
-------------------------------

I've been known to say "Java is your nanny". That is, the Java compiler
tries to verify that your code is "safe" (or as safe as it can figure).

TPS: What kinds of issues can it check at compile time?

TPS: What kinds of issues might occur at runtime?

Runtime
-------

Other than objects and classes, what information should we be storing
at runtime?
