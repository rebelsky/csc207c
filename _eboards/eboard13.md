Questions
---------

_You can ask questions about anything related to the class!  Self gov
says that you **should** ask those questions._

### Java

### Administrative stuff

In CSC-161, we got detailed instructions for each assignment, laying
out each thing we were supposed to do.  Here, we get vague generalities.
That's hard!

> It's at least partially intentional.  I want you to get used to
  (a) dealing with incomplete specifications and (b) asking questions.
  As I hope class on Wednesday suggested, I'm happy to spend time in
  class answering questions.

It sucks that there are people who know much more than me here.

> It does.  I hope that things balance out as the semester progresses.
  We move on to algorithms and data structures next week.
