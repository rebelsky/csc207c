Revisiting our mental model
---------------------------

_Note: You can find code in [examples/inheritance](../examples/inheritance)._

We'll address some of the questions from the readings by revisiting
our mental model.

Questions
---------

### Inheritance

Can you explain how we use `super` in methods?

> You will most frequently use `super` in constructors to make a call
  to the appropriate constructor in the superclass.

> If you don't do so, Java will look for a zero-ary constructor in the
  superclass and call that.

> At times, when we want to use a method from the superclass that has
  been overridden in the subclass, we can write `super.methodName`.

How do we know when to use interfaces and when to use inheritance?

> Practice.

> In general, we use inheritance when we have fields and methods we want
  to reuse from another class.

> We use interfaces when we don't have that kind of reuse.

> We use either when we want to write functions that work with multiple
  similar objects.

Do you need to specify `public` or `private` for all fields?

> Nope. There's also "package" (writing nothing) and `protected`.

> I prefer package protection because it often achieves the right level
  of protection (available to other classes in the same package, but
  not classes outside the package).

What's wrong with these as solutions to the self checks?

```
public class StaffMember extends Person {
  String department;
}

public class Administrator extends person {
}
```
