Administrivia

### Introductory notes

* Warning!  Today is Friday the 13th (class).
* Today's lab is somewhat rewritten.  Fingers crossed that everything works
  okay.
    * Make sure that you are using the repo named something like
      `lab-exceptions-vscode`.
* If it looks like VSCode is spending forever Java stuff, click on the
  "see more" link (something like that) and then close the box that
  appears.
* "It sucks that there are people who know much more than me here."
* Today is (almost) our last day on Java.  Starting next week, we'll be
  using Java to build ADTs, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
