Preparation for the sorting competition
---------------------------------------

### The process

* We pair off people.
* We ask them (their code) to sort N arrays.
    * The size is big enough that the slowest takes more than 200 milliseconds.
    * The arrays can be already sorted, reverse sorted, completely
      randomized, slightly randomized from sorted, or slightly
      randomized from reverse sorted.
* In the first phase, each person describes their algorithm, how
  they wrote it, and what they learned.
* The top four or so each earn a token.

### What are N and the probabilities?

* We'll talk about N and the probabilities.
* Please read the code in [examples/sorting/SortTools.java](../examples/sorting/SortTools.java)
    * 5 minutes of reading
    * 3 minutes of pairing
    * 5 minutes of discussin

Discussion


Competition
-----------

We don't quite have 32 competitors (and certainly not 68), so we'll
do the best we can.

No, it doesn't get logged here.
