Rules for the sorting competition
---------------------------------

* We pair off people.
* We ask them (their code) to sort N arrays.
    * The size is big enough that the slowest takes more than 200 milliseconds.
    * The arrays can be already sorted, reverse sorted, completely 
      randomized, slightly randomized from sorted, or slightly
      randomized from reverse sorted.
* We'll talk about N and the probabilities.
* Please read the code in [examples/sorting/SortTools.java](../examples/sorting/SortTools.java)
* In the first phase, each person describes their algorithm, how
  they wrote it, and what they learned.
* The top four or so each earn a token.

What we learned:

* There's code that tries to find a useful size.  It will fail (run
  too long) on BogoSort.
* It generates the array somewhat randomly (although in sorted order).
* There are at least four different kinds of arrays we might sort.
* There's a lot of randomness.  It feels like BozoSort, inverted.
* The code was structured somewhat clearly with lots of comments
* The code somehow magically works for every sorter: Yay polymorphism.

The competition!
