Rules for the sorting competition
---------------------------------

* We pair off people.
* We ask them to sort N arrays.
    * The size is big enough that the slowest takes more than 200 milliseconds.
    * The arrays can be already sorted, reverse sorted, completely 
      randomized, slightly randomized from sorted, or slightly
      randomized from reverse sorted.
* We'll talk about N and the probabilities.
* In the first phase, each person describes their algorithm, how
  they wrote it, and what they learned.
* The top four or so each earn a token.

The competition!
