Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Notes / Etc.

* Class work
    * I have dropped MP 11.
    * I have dropped one of the LAs (design patterns).
    * Because I have not caught up on tokens, everyone has infinitely 
      many tokens.  (You may not use tokens to make up for missing readings, 
      labs, pre-reflections, or post-reflections.)
    * I've added redos for all the mini-projects so that you can fix things 
      you already know are wrong (or submit them if you did not submit
      them the first time).
    * The graders are still working on catching up. They've been hit by
      end-of-semester busy-ness.
* Preregistration
    * Multiple second-years did not get a CS class in the spring. I don't
      know how many. The CS department isn't happy about this result, but
      don't really have a way to address it.
    * We plan to have more faculty next year, so we hope that (a) we won't
      have the problem again and (b) those who need two courses next year
      will be able to get two courses.
* Lots of TPS today to prepare you for lab

### Other good things (no tokens)

Questions
---------

### Administrative

**Can we get an I on an MP and still get an A?**

> No.

### Graphs

### Miscellaneous

Graph traversal
---------------

_TPS_

Suppose you start at one vertex in the graph and want to find all the vertices
you can reach from that vertex. What approach(es) might you take?

How is graph traversal similar to tree traversal?

How is graph traversal different than tree traversal?

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
----------------------------------

_TPS_

What is a shortest path?

* Inputs:
* Outputs:
* Characteristics:

What are the core ideas of Dijkstra's algorithm?

*
*

### The algorithm

```text
To find the shortest path from SOURCE to SINK,
  Indicate that all vertices have infinite distance from SOURCE
  Indicate that SOURCE has a distance of 0 from itself
  While unmarked(SINK) and there exists an unmarked node with finite distance from SOURCE
    Find the nearest unmarked vertex, U
    Mark U
    For each unmarked neighbor, V, of U
      If distanceTo(U) + edgeWeight(U,V) < distanceTo(V)
        Note that the best known path to V is the path to U plus the
          edge from U to V.
        Update the distance to V
  Report the path to SINK, if there is one
```

Implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
-----------------------------------------------

_TPS_

### a. How will you represent the distance (sum of edge weights) from the source to each vertex?

### b. How will you represent the path to each vertex?

### c. How will you efficiently "find the nearest unknown vertex", particularly given that the distance of vertices can change?

### d. How will you mark vertices?
