Preliminaries
-------------

* Don't forget the CS picnic tonight!
* I have no office hours planned for next week. I will either be working
  at home or traveling to the hospital. Use Teams messages or email
  to reach me. If you need to talk, we'll set up a time to Teams videoconf.
* Sunday is Mother's day (in the US). If you are fortunate enough to have
  a mother with whom you have a good relationship, make sure to thank them.

Idea: In most cases, instead of asking you to answer particular
questions, I ask you to find appropriate evidence that you've
mastered the topic.
