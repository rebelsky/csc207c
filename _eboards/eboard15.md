Lab

Why do we fork and then clone?

> So that you have your own copy of the code.  You can push your changes
  and then share them your partner (or yourself on another computer)
  using the GitHub repo.

Are we paying attention to Sam?

> Probably not.  That means that there's a significant possibility that
  he will make fun of us on the eboard.

What should we call the class for exercise 4?

> `StringUtils.java`

Where can we find the code Sam is writing?

> Reload the lab page.
