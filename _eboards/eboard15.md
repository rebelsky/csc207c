Setting up Java projects for VSCode
----------------------------------

We're going to watch Sam try again. Maybe it will work better this time.

It did!

Note: If Sam updates the main repo, you can pull from into your fork
using the GUI and then pull from your fork into your clone using `git pull`.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### MP4

Should we be testing private methods?

> Not directly.

> Whoops. Sam sometimes makes bad design decisions. Fixing them
  can cause problems.

Can we look at the `find` method?

> Done.

### LAs

I don't feel like getting the LAs done by tonight. Can I have an extension?

> No.

> But you'll be able to submit exactly the same LAs next Friday (as
  well as others).
