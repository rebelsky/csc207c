### Philosophy

_What's the underlying (overarching) philosophy of Scheme lists?_

### Uses

### Key methods

_These are the ones we couldn't write ourselves._

### Other methods

_These are ones we could write ourselves, but would prefer to have a 
standard implementation._

### Layout

### Implementation

### Analysis

in 161? Don't think about the implementation. Think about how they are
organizing information._
