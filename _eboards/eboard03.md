**Warning** This class is being recorded.

_Getting started_ (this will be our normal start-of-class sequence)

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first, start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

_Approximate overview_

### Introductory notes

* Sorry that I did not get the VScode reading written.  See below for issues.
* Our class site is still under development.  Let me know if you find
  things missing, including images.
    * Those slash things on the syllabus usually indicate something
      that I plan to post.  If they show up for a reading, let me know.
* Normal office hours are in-person (unless you'd prefer to do them
  remotely).
* Apologies: I have some significant personal issues that may make me less
  available in person in the coming weeks.  I will do my best to be available 
  via email and Teams chat.
    * These issues have also put me behind.  Apologies for that, too.
* I've moved the Git/VSCode labs to Friday.
