**You are probably being recorded, perhaps even transcribed.**

_Getting started_ (this will be our normal start-of-class sequence)

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.  <-------
* Navigate to the computer.
* Whoever arrives first, log in.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

Preliminaries
-------------

* In case it wasn't clear from my comments, I see great value in 
  process-oriented pseudo-recitation sessions.
    * You should be learning to design ADTs and data structures
    * You should be learning to implement data structures
    * I expect you to remember and apply "PUM" and "LIA"
        * I'm happy to hear suggestions for alternative TLAs.
        * And don't forget to ask when you don't understand a TLA.
* Any thoughts about the 12x difference in reading speeds?
    * Those taking less time might want to take notes.
    * Those taking more time may want to discuss ways to be more
      efficient.
