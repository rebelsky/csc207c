#### Misc

### Other good things (no tokens)

Questions
---------

### Administrative

**What did it mean that SoLA 6 was optional?**

> It meant that you didn't have to do it.

**But I don't have to do any SoLAs!**

> It was a bit more optional than most.

**Will the new questions on SoLA 6 appear on other SoLAs?**

> Yes. You can pretend that they are new for SoLA 7. There will also be
  a few other new ones for SoLA 7. (We need about 5--6 new LAs per SoLA.)

**I'm almost out of token space. Will you add more?**

> Yes. I guess I should read those.

**Do therapy dogs count for tokens?**

> Yes. But I prefer if you remind me so that they get on the list (so that
  I can remind others).

**Do yoga and forest bathing count for tokens?**

> Yes. But I prefer if you remind me so that they get on the list (so that
  I can remind others).

### Readings

**Can we talk about loop invariants?**

> We will do a loop invariants problem on Thursday.

### Miscellaneous

Lab
---

The person closer to the board is Driver A. The person further from the board is Driver B.

Make sure that the name of the repo ends with `-maven`.

### Questions

**What's this with `(str) -> ...`?**

> That's a lambda, a cool feature of Java when you have interfaces that
  specify only one function.

> This build a new Predicate with a test method whose body is the ellipses.

> `SearchUtils.search(strings, (str) -> str.length() < 5);`

**Are there other ways to make predicates?**

> Sure. You could use an anonymous inner class or you could even make a
  named class.

**What would the AIC look like?**

> ```
    Predicate<String> lessThanFiveChars = new Predicate<String>() {
      public boolean test(String str) {
        ...
      } // test(String)
    };
```

**How do I iterate an `Iterable`?**

> With a for-each loop.

> ```java
    for (TYPE VAR : ITERABLE) {
      ...
    } // for
```

**How should we find the midpoint of the region given by `lb` and `ub`?**

> Most people use `(lb + ub) / 2`.

> I prefer `lb + (ub - lb) / 2`.

> You could also use `lb / 2 + ub / 2 + ...`, where the ellipses handle the
  issue that both might be odd. This one is probably safest.

### Oh no! It's storytime with Sam!

* Many programmers write binary search wrong, even though it's a well-known
  algorithm.
* Good testing helps.
* Even "provably correct" code can be wrong if we're not careful about what
  we're proving.
