Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Notes / Etc.

* We have both talking and lab today.
* If you haven't done so yet, please sign up for 
  <https://passwordreset.grinnell.edu>.
* Note that "lower-bound inclusive, upper-bound exclusive" is a common
  approach.  Think about, say, `String.substring(lb, bu)`. I strongly
  ecnourage you to use it.
* I've added a three-day extension for MP9. It's now due on Sunday to
  give you another weekend.
* Grading updates
    * MPs/A: Was 5E, 5M, 1R, now 4E, 5M, 2R
    * MPs/B: Was 3E, 6M, 2R, now 2E, 5M, 3R
    * MPs/C: Was 2E, 5M, 4R, now 1E, 5M, 5R
    * MPs/D: Remains 4M, 5R, 2I
    * LAs/A: Was 46/48, now 45/48
    * LAs/B: Was 44/48, now 43/48
    * LAs/C: Was 42/48, now 41/48
    * LAs/D: Remains 15/48

### Other good things (no tokens)

Notes on MP9
------------

* Goals of assignment
    * Build something like a linked list
    * Build iterators for the structure
    * In a non-trivial context
    * Reading documentation for library classes
* Due date extended until Sunday (with late assignments accepted until Tuesday).
* These hashes are not the same as the hash values/hash codes we use for 
  hash tables.
    * The also aren't the same as hash tables.
    * These hashes are values we compute so that we can validate data in the future. If we compute a hash now and compute a hash later, the two hashes should be the same. (Hashes are generally smaller than the data.)

Questions
---------

### Administrative

The ACM Code of Ethics
----------------------

Designing a Dictionary (Map) ADT
--------------------------------

Strategy: 

* A generalized way to create a collection in which you can look up values
  by their corresponding keys.
* "Arrays with homogeneous keys of types other than integer".

Applications:

* Keep track of deposits in a block chain.
* Keep track of the relationship between images and words that those
  images represent.
* Keep track of student grades.

Methods:

Implementing the Dictionary (MAP) ADT
-------------------------------------

Arrangements

* Associative Array: An array of key/value pairs.
* Association List: A list of key/value pairs.
* Binary search tree: A tree in which smaller keys fall to the left
  and larger keys fall to the right. (This holds at every node.)
* Heap: Forthcoming.
* Hash table: Forthcoming.

Binary search trees
-------------------

Let $$n$$ be the number of elements in the tree and $$h$$ be the height of the tree.
