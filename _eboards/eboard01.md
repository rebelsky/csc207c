Preliminaries
-------------

* Consider grabbing a mask.
    * Even before covid, post winter break was full of illnesses.
    * The graphs I've seen suggest that covid incidence is rising.
* Sit where you'd like, within reason.
* If you don't know the people next to you, please introduce yourselves.

### News / Etc.

* Welcome to CSC207!
* I'm Sam (or SamR)
* Our class mentor is Elene Sturua
* We'll be using two "books" for this course: The readings I write (or
  wrote) and CLRS.
* I type class notes in markdown and post to the Web site.
    * It's like magic (I hope).
* You will find that I call on students randomly using a set of cards
  with your names on them.
    * I use this process to give you practice "thinking on your feet",
      as it were.
    * I also use this process to help everyone realize that they are
      not the only one who is puzzled.
    * And I use the process to push you a bit.
    * Feel free to say "I'm not sure" or "I'd prefer not to answer."
    * If you don't want to be called on in class, please let me know.
* We are a community. Treat each other with respect. If you (think you)
  know more than your partner, support, don't overwhelm. 
* Sam has some personal issues. There may be some hiccups in the class.

### Upcoming work

    * It will take me at least a few weeks to learn all of your names.

    * "You can call me PRIMARY_NAME."
    * "If you must address me by surname, you can call me
      Mr./Ms./Mx./Sr./Srta./etc. SURNAME [San]."
    * "This semester, I'm looking forward to ...."
    * Optional: A question

### Questions

* What's the work in the class?
    * Weekly mini-projects (some individual, some group). Goal of 3-5 hours.
        * EMRI
        * First redo is free (for MR).
        * Subsequent redos cost tokens.
        * When Sam is organized, there will be a clear rubric.
    * Portfolio learning assessments (for the most part)
        * E.g., Learning Objective: Parse Input
        * Submit: Code you've written + a bit of explanation.
        * All online, arbitrary amounts of time (well, a week)
    * A few LAs will involve a direct question.
    * Free redos on all LAs (as many as you need).
    * Sam will release LAs every week or two, if all goes well.
* How should we contact you.
    * Preference: Teams
    * Alternate: Email. Send a reminder if I don't respond within a day.
    * Emergency: Text. 641-990-2947.
    * Serious emergency: Call.
* How frequent is the group work?
    * Labs (almost) every class.
    * Probably 3/12 mini-projects.
* How do tokens work?
    * I charge them automatically.
    * You apply for new tokens on a not-yet-available Gradescope problem set.
* What's a SoLA?
    * Cruft from an old version of the course. "Set of learning assessments."
* Do we have to turn in every individual lab?
    * TBD.
    * Likely the "Sam says stop here" model.
    * Even if I don't require you to turn in everything, you should still
      reflect on the remainder (or actually do the remainder).
* What's the rhythm of the course?
    * Mini-projects released every Wednesday, due every Tuesday at 11pm.
    * LAs released approximately weekly starting in week two. Released
      on Friday, due the following Friday (probably late).
* Are groups for assignments assigned or self selected?
    * Class/lab: Random
    * Mini-projects: Both
* What's the late work policy?
    * 1 token for up to two days. Applies to readings, labs, metacognitive
      reflections, mini-projects. (Not LAs; no late LAs.)
* What will class time look like?
    * Varies.
    * Basic model one: Sam answers accumulated reading questions then you
      work on lab in randomly assigned pairs while we wander around and
      ask you questions. (And answer your questions.)
    * Basic model two: Sam answers accumulated reading questions then
      ask you some design questions which we do in a Think-Pair-Share (TPS)
      model.
    * Basic model three: Same first part; something like a tech interview.
* When are your office hours?
    * Still TBD
    * Feel free to TM me to set up a time.
* Are there exams?
    * No. The LAs serve as the exam equivalent.
* What are metacognitive reflections?
    * Required opportuities to reflect on your learning.
    * See the page in handouts.
* Will we be expected to use Javadoc?
    * Of course.
* Will we be expected to follow standard style guidelines for writing
  Java code or can we write random crap like we've done in the past?
    * Google Java style guidelines
    * Those specify an indentation of two spaces.
    * Our IDE helps automatically reformat.
* How much of CLRS will we cover?
    * Not a lot.

Course goals
------------

* Teach you to be "real" computer scientists.
* Design and implement algorithms.
* Analyze algorithms.
* Design and implement and analyze data structures.
* Build non-trivial program.

For building non-trivial programs

* Use OOD
* Use some standard tools (IDEs, (potentially) build tools, version control
  systems)

Course structure
----------------

_See above._

ADTs and data structures
------------------------

* Ways of organizing collections of data.
* ADT (abstract data type): Overall philosophy/methods (the interface)
* Data structure: Underlying implementation (organize data in memory
  and the effects of doing so)

_Don't forget to ask me when I use a TLA that you don't understand._

Designing a stack ADT (an exercise)
-----------------------------------

We will use the Think-Pair-Share (TPS) approach.

ADT: Use the PUM method for ADTs.

* P: Philosophy (organizing principle)
* U: Uses (or use cases)
* M: Methods

The philosophy of stacks

* Stacks are collections of data in which you can add and remove data.
  You add and remove data only at the "top" of the stack.
* Stacks follow a last-in, first-out policy; the thing you remove
  is the most-recently-added of the things still on the stack.

Some uses (we could use stacks for ...)

* To-do list: Or maybe not. The first thing you add will be the last
  thing you do (and you may never get it done).
* (Helps with building one-to-one functions.)
* The back button on a standard browser usually keeps track of a stack
  of the things you've seen.
* Most programming languages have a "call stack", where they put the
  context of a procedure on a stack of procedure contexts. This is
  particularly useful for recursive procedures.
* Simulating the stack of plates in the dining hall.

Core methods:

* `??? push(???)` - add an element
    * C: `void push(string_stack *s, char *str)`
    * Requires not full.
* `??? pop(???)` - remove and return an element
    * C: `char *pop(string_stack *s);`  (Requires not empty)
* `char *peek(string_stack *s);` - look at the top value, but don't
  remove it.  (Requires not empty)
* `boolean isEmpty(string_stack *s);`
* `boolean isFull(string_stack *s);`

Optional methods:

* `void popmany(string_stack *s, int num_to_pop);`
    * Who needs for loops? We just want to throw stuff away without
      looking at it.
    * perhaps `char ** popmany(string_stack *s, int num_to_pop);`
* `int size(string_stack *s);`
