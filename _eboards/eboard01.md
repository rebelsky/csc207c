Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* Welcome to CSC207!
* I'm Sam (or SamR)
* Our class mentor is Pom Dao.
* Since it's the first day of class, I will take attendance.  (_It will take
  me a few weeks to learn all of your names._)
    * "Hi, my name is FORENAME SURNAME."
    * "You can call me PRIMARY_NAME."
    * "If you must address me by surname, you can call me
      Mr./Ms./Mx./[nothing] SURNAME."
    * "This semester, I'm excited about TOPIC"
    * Optional: "My pronouns are ...."
* I realize that PUM and LIA (from the readings) are horrid acronyms.  If
  you have better ones, I'd appreciate it.
* We'll be using two "books" for this course: The readings I write (or
  wrote) and the material that Peter-Michael wrote.  There's a link
  to his book under the Reference menu.  You can grab either the whole
  book or individual chapters.

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 1](../assignments/assignment01) due Thursday night (not tomorrow).
* Readings due before class Friday.
    * [An introduction to Java](../readings/intro-java)
    * [Simple Java for C progammers](../readings/simple-java-c)
    * [Arrays in Java](../readings/arrays)
