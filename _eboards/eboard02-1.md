* Identify where the corresponding computer is.
* Return the card to the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* The first person at the computer logs in.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

_Approximate overview_

* Preliminaries
    * Notes and news
    * Upcoming work
    * Extra credit
    * Questions
* Lab one: Getting started with Java
* Lab two: Getting strated with Maven

Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* No attendance today, but please say your name when answering or asking
  questions.
* I will ask you to stop the first lab when there are about 30 minutes
  left. Submit what you have at that point. Then do the Maven lab.
* The Maven lab is all new, so there may be issues.
* My wife has taken a turn for the worse, so I will only be on campus
  for my classes (and a few other appointments). I'd prefer asynchronous
  conversations to synchronous, but will set up synchronous appointments
  by request. (Email me or DM me for those requests.)

### Upcoming work

* Readings due Wednesday night
    * [An introduction to Git](../readings/git)
    * [An introduction to GitHub](../readings/github)
    * [An introduction to VSCode](../readings/vscode)
    * [Getting started with Visual Studio Code (video)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
* Optional: Submit [reading questions for class 3](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/818402/assignments/4871387/) by 10:30 pm on Wednesday
* Mini-project 1 to be distributed on Thursday.

Questions
---------

Why are you making us create `PrintWriter` objects rather than using 
`System.out`?

> Because it makes your code more general (at least once things get more
  complex). It takes a moment to switch your `PrintWriter` from stdout
  to a file, while you'd have to change a lot of lines if you were
  using `System.out`.

> Start with good habits, rather than bad.

Could you explain more about static keyword in java? In the reading, it says (static indicates that the method can run without having an associated object created),, but I don't quite understand.

Could you make the for(String name: names) thing more clearer because I don't know exactly what name or names represent or String. For example, if String is just where the type goes then just clarify that it is the where the type of the array goes and the same for the rest.

How do Maven and other build tools (like Gradle or Ant) compare in terms of features and ease of use?

Is a class interchangeable with a file? In other words, can one file only contain one class?

In the input and output section where you were making an object of class PrintWriter, how did you know the parameters of that class? 

Is there a difference between import in Java and #include in C?

Could you explain the difference between ADTs and Data Structures in a less abstract way? I'm still a bit confused about that. 

Why we put static on the main class?

Please explain why we need to use 'new' in Java. What's the functionality?

Lab: Getting Started with Java

The person closer to the screen is partner A. The person further from the 
screen is partner B.

Lab: Getting Started with Maven

If you finish early, spend time configuring your partner's account.
