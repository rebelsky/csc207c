Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* No attendance today, but please say your name when answering or asking
  questions.
* I will ask you to stop the first lab when there are about 30 minutes
  left. Submit what you have at that point. Then do the Maven lab.
* The Maven lab is all new, so there may be issues.
* My wife has taken a turn for the worse, so I will only be on campus
  for my classes (and a few other appointments). I'd prefer asynchronous
  conversations to synchronous, but will set up synchronous appointments
  by request.

### Upcoming work

* Readings due Wednesday night
    * [An introduction to Git](../readings/git)
    * [An introduction to GitHub](../readings/github)
    * [An introduction to VSCode](../readings/vscode)
    * [Getting started with Visual Studio Code (video)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
* Submit [reading response for class 3](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/818402/assignments/4871387/) by 10:30 pm on Wednesday
