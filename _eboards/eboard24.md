Administrivia
-------------

* Registration starts next Wednesday.  I hope that you consider going on.
    * Check the priority registration page at <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrars_Office/SitePages/PriorityRegistration.aspx> for our latest registration processes.  They have changed since Monday.
    * Check out the the priority rules for each class at <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Registrars_Office/EQfHJD0_kHlMgqJDvkATg18B8k6Sc5C_SOtUiQ51Ig2LZg?e=HQS7zq>.  CSC's were not yet up-to-date when I last checked.
    * Our chair says that we are adding another section of CSC-301.
    * I have confirmed that we are not prioritizing undeclared second-year students over declared second-year students (or vice versa).
* There are signs around campus for an event at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 23rd.  Since today is October 25, I assume the event is Wednesday, October 23rd, 2024.

Designing algorithms
--------------------

Remember that question?  Where do you get started when you have to design 
a new algorithm.

Sam's two initial suggestions:

* "Do it by hand."
* "Look for similar problems."

_TPS_: What other techniques do you use?
