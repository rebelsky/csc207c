Preliminaries
-------------

* It looks like we have about 70 majors in the class of 2026. Welcome to
  the prospective new majors in this class.
    * Even though some of you ranked me as second to last, I will not
      hold that against you. Not everyone thrives in chaos.
* Some of you didn't seem to start MP4 until this Tuesday. I would
  recommend that you start much earlier.
