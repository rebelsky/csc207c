### Good things to do (no tokens)

### Friday PSA

Questions
---------

### Administrative

When will we get mini-projects back?

> I set a goal of two weeks.

### MP2

### Testing and Debugging

How do I start a debugging session on VSCode?

> Add a breakpoint.

> In the upper right hand corner, click on the down arrow and then "Debug
  Java".

Why is there an `&lt;` in the reading?

> It's HTML for a less-than sign. These documents have been converted
  too many times and I missed that.

Why couldn't I use Junit in VScode?

> Computers are sentient and malicious.

> Or maybe you needed to set up a path to the junit.jar file.

Reminders

* Not everyone likes to work at separate computers. Make sure your
  partner is okay with it.
