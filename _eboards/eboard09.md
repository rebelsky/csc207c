* Lab
* Discussion of MP3

Preliminaries
-------------

* We have class 9 on the 9th. Yay!
* There are many sick people on campus. Consider masking.
* Feel free to send me questions on Teams, even at night. If I'm available,
  I'll answer them quickly. If not, I'll try to answer them the next day.
* If you are unable to visit class in person, it's fine to attempt to
  visit on Teams. (Please try to make it to class if you can.)
* Our evening tutors are likely to be busy on nights when HW is due (Wednesday)
  and the night before (Tuesday), so starting earlier can help.
* Don't forget to say your name when you ask a question.

Lab

Reminders

* Not everyone likes to work at separate computers. Make sure your
  partner is okay with it.

Notes

* `double` vs `Double`
    * `double` is a primitive type. Four bytes, IEEE representation.
    * `Double` is an object that wraps up a `double` and provides the
      various operations we'd expect for an object, such as `toString`
      and `hashCode`.

Do not submit.
