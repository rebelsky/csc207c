Preliminaries
-------------

* I'll take attendance today as I work on learning your names.
* Since today is a "set up the lab equipment" day, it's okay if you
  spread out to all the computers or use your laptops to connect to
  MathLAN. (It's only okay for today.)
* I've set up a [simple style handout](../handouts/style) that covers
  most of the issues I've observed.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

What should I enter as the academic honesty boilerplate on labs?

> I just want you to cite those who gave you help.

When will your office hours be available?

> Soon.

### MP1

What should the `README.md` file look like?

    # Project Name 

    Your name
    The date
    Acknowledgements 

    A short description. 

    Instructions for running the program.

### GitHub

Why can't I push to my GitHub repo?

> I'm not sure, but I can look at it with you.

> Note that it's important that you've set up your keypairs and that
  you use the `git@github.com` URL in setting up the repo.

> You can edit `.git/config` to change the repo you use.

Lab
---

One of you will do this. The other of you will have to do so on your
own. For today (and today only), it's okay to spread out to more
computers or to use your laptop.

### Questions

Do we do the same setup on our own computers?

> No. You'll need to configure VSCode slightly differently.  In
  particular, the location of Java may be different.

> You may also need to copy your ssh key from MathLAN.
