Administrivia
-------------

* I have no scheduled office hours during Finals Week. I will be in
  my office as much as I can. Feel free to DM me to check if I'm there
  or to ask questions.
* MP redos have not been posted. 
* Since we'll be doing EOCEs in class on Friday and have fewer
  computers than students, it would be nice if some of you brought 
  your laptops on Friday.
