Questions
---------

### Administrative

What Java style do you want?

> I want you to follow the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

Will I be charged a token for redoing an MP?

> See [the token policies](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2023Fa/handouts/tokens) for details.

> If you got an R or an M, there is no charge for the first redo
  (unless you turn it in late).

> If you got an I or did not turn in the mini-project, you must
  spend one token to turn in the redo (and a second if you turn it
  in late).

> Second redos cost two tokens.  If you didn't turn in the first
  redo, the second redo stil counts as a second redo.

### MP5
