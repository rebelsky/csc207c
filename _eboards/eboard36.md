_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia 
* Questions
* Lab

Preliminaries
-------------

* Does anyone not have a partner for MP10?
* I apologize if I'm even more disorganized than normal. I spent three
  hours dealing with registration between last night and this morning
  and another hour dealing with academic honety issues.
* On the first topic: It appears that the Registrar held out an absurdly
  large number of seats in CS courses. So fingers crossed on positive
  changes moving ahead.
* On the second topic: I use mastery grading for a lot of reasons.
  One is to reduce the incentive to cheat; the penalty for getting
  something wrong is supposed to be low, since you can try again. If
  you feel yourself inclined to do something questionable, please talk
  to me about your stress levels and how we can manage them.
* Let's try to get through administrative stuff quickly so that there's
  more time for lab.
