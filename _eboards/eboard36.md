* Happy Turkey break!
* I'll keep trying to update due dates. Email me if you need one fixed.
* I'll be working on the real whiteboard for the second half of class.  I'll try to
  remember to have the camera on. Perhaps I should ask someone to take photos.
* I asked President Harris what I should say to you about not getting into CS classes.
* On a more positive note, the person teaching CSC-301 makes me feel old.
