Questions
---------

### Registration

### Trees/BSTs

### Administrative

When will we get MP1 redos back?

> I'll check with the graders.

Where are the LAs?

> Coming soon.  All take-home.  All open-ended.  All infinite (well,
  arbitrarily finite) redos.

### MP8

### Other

Binary Search Trees
-------------------

Um, Aardvark, Penguin, Cat, Panda, Frog, Elk, Squid, Dog, Jellyfish

How do we remove things?

* Leaves: Easy.  Just remove the link to the child.
* Interior nodes with only one child: Build the link over the node.
* Interior nodes with two children.
    * Rebuild the tree (expensive)
    * What's more efficient (remaining $$O(height)$$)?
    * Delete the rightmost thing in the left subtree (or the leftmost
      thing in the right subtree) and put its value in the current node.
    * Historically: "And rebalance, if we can do it efficiently" (301)

"Wow, writing `set` recursively is much easier than writing it iteratively."
