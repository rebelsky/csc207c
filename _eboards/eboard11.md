A design exercise
-----------------

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### MP3

### Generics

What is a "functional interface" (from the java documentation for Function)?

> One in which there is only one non-default method, which means that we can implement it with a lambda expression.

What is the difference between `andThen` and `compose`? (from Java documentation for `Function`)

> Both compose functions. `andThen` builds a new function that applies the parameter function *after* the current function while `compose` builds a new function that applies the parameter *before* the current function.

> For example, if `dub` is a function that doubles its parameter and `inc` is a function that adds one, `dub.andThen(inc).apply(5)` would double 5, giving 10, and then add 1, giving 111.

> In contrast, `dub.compose(inc).apply(5)` would increment 5 first, giving 6, and then double it, giving 12.
