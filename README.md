# csc207c

One of the SamR's too-many vesions of CSC-207.  This version was created in Fall 2023.

The special characteristics of this version include the following.

* A return to "A TAO of Java" rather than the Osera text (which I think hasn't been updated in a while).
* Includes SamR's too-detailed course policies.
* Includes some focus on preparing for technical interviews.
* Relies on mastery grading.
* Includes something else that I've forgotten about.
* Links to appropriate parts of CLRS4.

Most of the other versions of the course can be found on GitHub in my personal repository, <https://github.com/rebelsky>.
