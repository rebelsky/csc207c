title: Mini-Project 5
subtitle: Augmentive and Alternative Communication Devices
summary: |
  In this mini-project, you will use an extended version of the
  AssociativeArray class from the last mini-project to build a
  sample AAC.
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this project. You may
  consult other students in the class as you develop your solution.  If you
  receive help from anyone, make sure to cite them in your responses.

In this mini-project, you will explore (a) the use of associative arrays and other kinds of maps, (b) programming to specifications in support of a larger project, (c) dealing with conflicting approaches to Java programming, and (d) considering some of the issues at play in designing software for people with disabilities (and using software as a disabled person).

## The assignment

Do the assignment at <https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AAC.html>, using your `AssociativeArray` class instead of `HashMaps`.  Please leave your `AssociativeArray` and `KVPair` classes in the `structures` package.

## Recommended stages

To do this assignment, you should follow these steps, modifying them as you consider appropriate.

* Read the instructionsi an background.
* Fork and clone the repository at <https://github.com/catiembaker/AACNestedHW>.
* Add your structures package to the repository.
* Create an `AACCategory` class with stub methods that follows the specifications given at <https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AACCategory.html>.
   * Note that your `AACCategory` class will likely contain an `AssociativeArray<String,String>` that maps image locations (strings) to words (also strings).
* Create an `AACMappings` class with stub methods that follows the specifications given at <https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AACMappings.html>.
   * Note that your `AACMappings` class will likely contain an `AACCategory` object that maps the filenames various category images to their corresponding names as well as an `AssociativeArray<String,AACCategory>` that maps either filenames or names to categories.
   * Sample stub versions of `getImageLocs()`, `getTexst(String)`, and `getCurrentCategory()` follow.
* Run the application to get a basic sense of how it works (or should work).
   * _Warning!_ At least on my computer, it takes a while to load.
* Start implementing methods.

Note that you will likely need to update `AssociativeArray` to support methods like `getImageLocs()`.

## Sample stub methods

```
  public String[] getImageLocs() {
    return new String[] { "img/food/icons8-french-fries-96.png", "img/food/icons8-watermelon-96.png" }; // STUB
  } // getImageLocs()

  public String getText(String actionCommand) {
    return "television";  // STUB
  }

  public String getCurrentCategory() {
    return "food";  // STUB
  }
```
