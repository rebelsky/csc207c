_Warning!  This MP is still in draft form._

In this mini-project, you will continue our text layout / text block example.

1\. Implement `Truncated.java`, `Centered.java`, and `RightJustified.java`,
as described in [the lab](../labs/subtype-polymorphism.html).

2\. Implement `HorizontallyFlipped.java` and `VerticallyFlipped.java`, which
do what they say.  (That is, rearrange the text blocks horizontally and
vertically.)

3\. Design and implement at least one other new kind of text block.

4\. There are (at least) three models of equality for `TextBlock` objects:

* Two textblocks are equal if they contain the same lines.
* Two textblocks are equal if they were built in the same way.
* Two textblocks are equal if they occupy the same memory location.

Implement these as `TBUtils.equal(TextBlock t1, TextBlock t2)`, `TBUtils.eqv(TextBlock t1, TextBlock t2)`, and `TBUtils.eq(TextBlock t1, TextBlock t2)`, respectively.  If you find it useful to require and implement similar procedures in each of the kinds of `TextBlocks` (e.g., every `TextBlock` must include `equal(TextBlock other)` or `eqv(TextBlock other)`), you can add them to the interface.

5\. Write appropriate tests for each of your procedures.  Make sure to check edge cases.

## Grading rubric

As this is a new assignment, the rubric may evolve slightly during grading.

### Redo or above

Submissions that fail to meet any of these requirements will get an I.

```
[ ] Includes the specified `.java` files, correctly named.  (They should
    be in the appropriate package.)
[ ] Each class has an introductory Javadoc comment that indicates
    the author and purpose. 
[ ] Includes a `README.md` file that contains the appropriate information 
    (authors, purpose, acknowledgements if appropriate)
[ ] All files compile correctly.
[ ] Includes one more text block.
```

### Meets expectations or above

Submissions that fail to meet any of these requirements but meet all
previous requirements will receive an R.

```
[ ] Appears to follow Google Java style guidelines for indentation and such.
[ ] Includes tests for each of the different kinds of textblocks as a
    top-level block.
[ ] `Truncated` works for widths at least 1 and less than or equal to 
    the width of the parameter block.
[ ] `Centered` works for widths greater than or equal to the width of 
    the parameter block.
[ ] `RightJustified` works for widths greater than or equal to the width
    of the parameter block.
[ ] `HorizontallyFlipped` works for nonempty blocks of two or more lines.
[ ] `VerticallyFlipped` works for nonempty blocks of two or more lines.
```

### Exemplary / Exceeds expectations

Submissions that fail to meet any of these requirements but meet all
previous requirements will receive an M.

```
[ ] All (or most) repeated code has been factored out into individual 
    methods.  
[ ] All or most variable names are appropriate.
[ ] Includes tests for each of the different kinds of text blocks as
    parameters to other text blocks (or themselves).
[ ] Tests include interesting edge cases, such as empty blocks.
[ ] `Truncated` works with a width of 0.
[ ] `Truncated` works with a width greater than the width of the
    parameter block.
[ ] `Centered` works with a width of 0.
[ ] `Centered` works with a width greater than the width of the 
    parameter block.
[ ] `HorizontallyFlipped` works with empty blocks (`new TextLine("")`).
[ ] `VerticallyFlipped` works with empty blocks (`new TextLine("")`).
```

## Q&A

What should a call to the `Truncated` constructor look like?
  : `new Truncated(myblock, 5)` truncates the block at 5 characters wide.

What happens when we truncate a `BoxedBlock`?
  : You probably lose the right side of the box.

What should a call to the `Truncated` constructor do if the width is greater than the width of the block?
  : The `Truncated` block should be the specified width.
  : I suppose it should expand the block with spaces at the right.

Do you have hints for `eqv`?
  : Option one: It could check the types of the objects and make sure
    that they are the same and then recurse on any components.
  : Option two: You could require that all `TextBlock` objects provide
    an `eqv(TextBlock other)` method that does something similar.
  : You should be able to figure out which is better.

Do you have hints for `eq`?
  : I'd use `==`.

What should we name the test file?
  : `TextBlockTests.java`

Should `Centered` and `RightJustified` truncate if necessary?
  : Yes.

What will my tests look like?
  : For example, if you create `new BoxedBlock(new TextLine("Hello"))`, you know that the width should be 7, the height should be 3, lines 0 and 2 should be `"+-----+"` and line 1 should be `"|Hello|"`.
  : To test `equal`, you can create a variety of equal boxed blocks in different ways.  For example, `new HorizontallyFlipped(new HorizontallyFlipped(new TextLine("Hello")))` should be equal to `new TextLine("Hello")` but not `eq` or `eqv`.

Can I just convert my text blocks to strings and compare those?
  : Sure.  I'd recommend that you add a static `toString(TextBlock block)`
    method to `TBUtils`.
