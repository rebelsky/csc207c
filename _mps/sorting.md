## Background: A generic sorting interface

As you might expect, we want to be able to switch sorting algorithms depending on a variety of circumstances, particularly characteristics we know about the data (e.g., that they are mostly in order or perhaps mostly reverse sorted).  Hence, rather than writing static `sort` methods, it may be more useful to define a generic `Sorter` interface and use that.  Here's one such interface.

```java
/**
 * Things that know how to sort arrays of values.
 *
 * @author Samuel A. Rebelsky
 *
 * @param <T>
 *   The type of value in the array.
 */
public interface Sorter<T> {
  /**
   * Sort an array in place.
   *
   * @param values
   *   an array to sort.
   *
   * @post
   *   The array has been sorted according to some order (often
   *   one given to the constructor).
   * @post
   *   For all i, 0 < i < vals.length,
   *     order.compare(vals[i-1], vals[i]) <= 0
   */
  public void sort(T[] values);
} // interface Sorter<T>
```

## Preparation

a. Fork the repository at <{{ page.repo }}>.

b. Clone that repository.

```text
cd ~/CSC207/MPs                 # Or the directory of your choice
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/mp-sorting-maven.git
```

c. Open the project in VSCode.

d. Update the `README.md` appropriately.

e. Push the updated `README` to GitHub.

```text
cd ~/CSC207/MPs/                # Or the directory of your choice
cd mp-sorting-maven
git add README.md
git status
git commit -m "Update README."
git pull
git push
```

f. Add an upstream repository just in case I make changes.

```text
cd ~/CSC207/MPs/                # Or the directory of your choice
cd mp-sorting-maven
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/mp-sorting-maven
```

In the future, you can grab changes using the following.

```text
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

You can also just click the **Sync Fork** button on your GitHub page for the fork.

## Part one: Testing

As I hope you know by now, when writing a small or medium-sized function or class, we should begin by writing test cases for the function or class.

In the file `TestSorter.java`, add at least five test cases for `Sorter<T>` objects. (The system is designed so that every test you put in `TestSorter` is now available to test all four sorting algorithms.)

## Part two: Implement common sorts

### Insertion sort

Create a new class, `InsertionSort`, that implements insertion sort.  The repo should include a framework for the class.

### Selection sort

Create a new class, `SelectionSort`, that implements insertion sort.  The repo should include a framework for the class.

### Merge sort

Create a new class, `MergeSort`, that implements merge sort.  The repo should include a framework for the class.

### Quicksort

Create a new class, `QuickSort`, that implements Quicksort.  The repo should include a framework for the class.

Once you've identified a pivot, I would recommend that you use the Dutch National Flag algorithm to partition the subarray into (a) things less than the pivot, (b) things equal to the pivot, and (c) things greater than the pivot.

## Part three: Your own sort

In practice, the best sorting algorithms do something a bit more clever. For example, it may be good to switch from merge sort to insertion sort once you reach a small enough subarray, or one that is mostly ordered.

Write your own sorting algorithm that attempts to do better than all of the prior $$O(nlogn)$$ sorting algorithms. You might pre-scan the input to look for patterns that suggest a particular algorithm, you might switch algorithms for small enough arrays, you might find something else clever to do.

Please name your class `LastFirstSort`.  For example, mine would be `RebelskySamuelSort`. Please do not reference methods in your other classes.

Include a description of your approach in your README file.

You should also add a tester for your sort to make sure that it works correctly. (The pattern of the other testers should make that straightforward.)

I will hold a competition to see whose sorting algorithm wins on different kinds of inputs. Winners will receive acclaim as well as an extra token or two.

On this part of the mini-project, _and **only** on this part of the mini-project_, you may use Copilot or other LLM as a programming assistant.  If you do so, make sure to provide appropriate citations.  I'd also appreciate it if you'd also add a short note about the experience of using CoPilot.

Note that your sorting mechanism is expected to be efficient in most cases. You should strive for no worse than $$O(n^2)$$.

## Questions and answers

**Is this an individual or group project?**

> I'd like each of you to have the experimence of writing the four key sorting algorithms, so it is an individual project.

**Can I use ChatGPT, Copilot, or similar AI tool on this assignment?**

> As per class policies, you may NOT use ChatGPT on parts one and two. I have, however, made an exemption to class policies for Part three.  You may use ChatGPT on Part three provided you cite it and provide a short narrative about your experience doing so.

**Can I talk to my peers about the assignment?**

> Of course.

**I've found that one of my sorting algorithms crashes on some inputs. What now?**

> You should debug. I'd suggest creating an experiment class in which you call the sorting routine on a known failing input, and step through your algorithm.

> You can use `QuicksortExperiments.java` for a sample experiment.

> Since we're often doing a lot of recursion in Quicksort and merge sort, you might also find it useful to insert some print statements. Make sure to print to `System.err` (as is good practice).

> You could ask someone else for help looking through your code.

> You can also ask Sam for help. Make sure to push your current version to GitHub and to provide the GitHub link.

**What does "repo should include a framework for the class" mean?**

> For example, you'll find a class called `Quicksorter.java` that is ready for you to fill in the Quicksort algorithm.

**Can I assume that if `obj1` "is less than" `obj2`, then `order.compare(obj1, obj2)` is `-1`?**

> **No!** If `obj1` "is less than" `obj2`, all you know is that `order.compare(obj1, obj2) < 0`. It could be `-1`. However, it could also be `-5` or `-32351` or any negative integer.

**Should we just let the FakeSorter tests fail?**

> Sure. You can also remove `TestFakeSorter` if you'd like.

**How long should we spend implementing each sort?**

> I would hope that you could implement insertion sort and selection sort in about 30 minutes each, while merge sort and Quicksort may take closer to an hour each.

> The biggest issue seems to be whether you hit bugs and how quickly you can identify those bugs.

**Why were these sorting algorithms chosen? in specific, why was bubble sort not included?**

**I remember learning bubble sort when I searched about sorting before this class. Do you have any opinions on this algorithm and its role in the first steps of learning sorting?**

> Bubble sort is one of the worst O(n^2) algorithms in practice. No one should ever implement bubble sort. Owen Astrachan has written [a longer explanation](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bubble/bubble.html).

**Are there particular data types or conditions where certain sorting algorithms tend to perform better or worse?**

> Insertion sort performs much better on already sorted (or mostly sorted) arrays. In fact, it's O(n) for already sorted arrays.

> Insertion sort performs much worse on reverse sorted (or mostly reverse-sorted) arrays.

> Other than that, I'm not sure that order makes that much difference.

### Quicksort

**Regarding the pivot in Quicksort, do you want us to implement it so that the pivot is always randomly chosen? Or can we just choose a pivot (first/middle/last) and use that each time?**

> I'd prefer that you choose a random pivot. It tends to give a better running time. Picking the median of three random pivots may be even better.

**There are lots of different Quicksorts out there. Do you care which we implement?**

> You can implement whichever you want, provide it has the key aspects of Quicksort. (UM): Divide and conquer algorithm, divide by a pivot (hopefully close to median), and rely on randomness to hope that get a good pivot.

### Your own sort

**I don't have any good ideas on how to get started.*

> "Hey ChatGPT, how can I write a fast sorting algorithm?"

**Does my sort have to be stable?**

> Nope.

**May we take advantage of parallel processing in our sorting algorithm?**

> No.

**If I use randomness, isn't there a chance that my algorithm will be inconsistent; sometimes fast and sometimes slow?**

> Certainly. The competition has multiple rounds to help alleviate such issues.

**Do we get to know what's different rounds of testing your competition will have?**

> I'm likely to do something like the `compete` aspect in `SortTools`.

**How different should our own sorting algorithm be from already existing algorithms to be considered "our own"? Can we implement an already existing algorithm that is not already included in the project?**

It can be similar. I'd like you to play with what changes you can make to extant algorithms to make them work better (and/or what other ideas you can come up with).

**What do you mean by creating your own sort? Does it mean that I can scan the whole array, and choose a fitting sorting technique based on the features? Or actually, create a new sorting technique similar to the ones we are implementing in part b?**

> I'd suggest a combination. Yes, you can pre-assess the data. You might choose to break the array up into parts and sort different parts with different algorithms. You could even just find ways to optimize one of the basic algorithms.

**Could our own algorithm use the other sorting algorithms we implemented?**

> Certainly. But I'd like you to copy over any code so that I can just use your one `.java` file.

**What aspects of a sorting algorithm might we consider to create a different one?**

> Whatever you think is useful. You should be prepared to sort any type of values as long as we have a comparator for them, so you can't design something based on, say, how you might partition integers.

### Sam's implementations

**Have you implemented all of these algorithms?**

> I've implemented each of them many times in my career. Just to be carefuol, I implemented all of them (including two versions of Quicksort) for this assignment in Fall 2024.

**How long did it take you to implement them?**

> I implemented insertion sort in about five minutes, including documentation and running tests. I implemented selection sort in about five minutes, including documentation (there's more of it) and running tests.

> Remember that (a) I first implemented each of these algorithms before any of you were born (and before many of my colleagues in the department were born) and (b) I've been teaching these algorithms since any of you were born.

> In writing Quicksort, I decided to try our new DNF algorithm before proving it correct. That was a bad idea, since the algorithm doesn't work correctly if one of the sections is empty. (We'll talk about that in class on Tuesday.) It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to track down the bug.

> When I switched to the standard DNF algorithm (the one with at most one swap per round), Quicksort took me twelve minutes.

> I suppose that's a reminder that it takes much less time when you get things right the first time.

> It's also a reminder that it may be better to check your algorithm by hand.

> Merge sort also took about twelve minutes. That included tracking down one stupid bug.

> As I said, I've been implementing these algorithms for longer than you've been alive.

## Additional notes

The project also includes an (still under development) `SortTools` class. That class can be used to find arrays large enough that sorting is worth timing. It can also be used to run simple competitions between different sorters.

Here's a typical test session (to be updated once Sam implements some sorting algorithms). You'll note that we see output for the empty array and then a SUCCESSS for everything else.

```text
$ mvn compile -q
$ java -cp target/classes edu.grinnell.csc207.main.SortTools test edu.grinnell.csc207.sorting.InsertionSorter
Testing of edu.grinnell.csc207.sorting.InsertionSorter
  Successfully sorted empty array.
  SUCCESS!
```

The only test whose result is printed is the empty array. That's because you don't need to successfully sort the empty array for an M, but you do need to sort it for an R.

Here's how we might use `SortTools` for timing. You'll note that it also tests after timing.

```text
$ mvn compile -q
$ java -cp target/classes edu.grinnell.csc207.main.SortTools time edu.grinnell.csc207.sorting.InsertionSorter

Here's an example of it testing a non-working sort routine. Note that we only see one failure.

```

As you can see, it's chosen a size in which both sorting routines take a few seconds on most inputs. It then chooses a variety of types of arrays and asks each to sort the same array, reporting on the time. In this particular case, you can also see that `InsertionSorter` does particularly poorly on reverse sorted arrays and slightly randomized reverse sorted arrays, but incredibly well on already sorted or only slightly randomized arrays.

Here's a competition between all of the sorting routines I've written in my solutions for this assignment. (I still have to design a faster one.)

Unsurprisingly, the $$O(nlogn)$$ algorithms are much faster.

We'll get much bigger arrays if we only compare those three.
