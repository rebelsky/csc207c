Introduction
------------

Braille is a tactile writing system used by people with visual impairments. Traditionally, braille was written by embossing paper. Today, people typically use a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. As for reading computer screens, braille users have the option of using refreshable braille displays. What makes it refreshable is whenever the user moves their cursor through keyboard or voice commands, the display updates the dots in the braille cells.

In this project, you will explore mechanisms for representing text in standard Braille and converting between Braille and other representations.

About Braille
-------------

As you know, computers encode all information, including strings, using binary enncoding.

Braille was the first writing system with binary encoding. The system as devised by Louis Braille consists of two parts:

* Character encoding that mapped characters of the alphabet to six bits (0's and 1's).
* The physical representation of those six-bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell.

Within an individual cell, the dot positions are arranged in a three by two grid. A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions, producing sixty-four possible patterns, including one in which there are no raised dots.

A braille letter is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised. The positions are universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left column and 4 to 6 on the right column. For example, an "M" is represented with cells 1, 3, 4 raised and 2, 5, 6 lowered (&#10253;).

```
1 4
2 5
3 6
```

(Figure 3) Braille cell numbering

Here's the full French/English (I'd call it "European") braille description, showing how Braille divided letters into "decades" of ten letters.  You'll notice that "W doesn't follow the pattern; that's because French did not use the letter W when Braille developed his system.

If you're wondering about the accented letters that French uses, you can find them where the accented letters are, you can find them in [French Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Braille).

In any case, we will need to think of braille encodings as six bits, numbered from 1 to 6, left to right.  For example, M is 101100.

Braille as a binary tree
------------------------

Suppose we were writing a program that helps someone learn braille.  How might we efficiently store a table that allows us to convert a braille letter to an alphabetic letter?

One approach would be to use a binary tree, one in which a 1 in the input means "go left" and a 1 in the input means "go right".  The leaves of the tree will be the values that correspond to the bits we followed to get there.  For example, if we start at the root and follow edges in the sequence right (1), left (0), right (1), right (1), left (0), and left (0), we should reach the letter "M"

Note that in these "Bit trees", the interior nodes have no associated values; only the leaves have values.  

Since English braille uses only six bits (and always uses six bits), a binary tree for English braille should have seven levels.

In contrast, if we were using a bit tree to convert ASCII characters to braille, we might need eight (7-bit ASCII) or nine (8-bit ASCII) levels.

Bit trees
---------

Create a class, `BitTree`, intended to store mappings from bits to values.

* A constructor, `BitTree(int n)`, that builds a tree that will store
  mappings from strings of n bits to strings.  We'd build our tree for
  mapping braille to ASCII with `new BitTree(6)`.  We'd build our tree
  for mapping ASCII to braille with `new BitTree(7)` or `new BitTree(8)`.
  _Do not create nodes in the tree until they are needed._
* A method, `set(String bits, String value)`, that follows the path 
  through the tree given by `bits` (adding nodes as appropriate) and
  adds or replaces the value at the end with `value`.  `set` should
  throw an exception if `bits` is the inappropriate length or contains
  values other than 0 or 1.
* A method, `String get(String bits)`, that follows the path through the
  tree given by `bits`, returning the value at the end.  If there is
  no such path, or if `bits` is the incorrect length, `get` should
  throw an exception.
* A method, `void dump(PrintWriter pen)`, that prints out the contents
  of the tree in CSV format.  For example, one row of our braille
  tree will be "101100,M"
* A method, `void load(InputStream source)`, that reads a series of
  lines of the form `bits,value` and stores them in the tree.

You will likely find it useful to create a `BitTreeNode` class and,
perhaps, a `BitTreeLeaf` class (a subclass of `BitTreeNode`?).

Braille trees
-------------

Create a class `BrailleASCIITables`, that provides the following
static methods:

* `String toBraille(char letter)`, which converts
  an ASCII character to a string of bits representing the
  corresponding braille character..
* `String toASCII(String bits)`, which converts a string of bits
  representing a braille character to the corresponding ASCII character.
* `String toUnicode(String bits)`, which converts a string of bits
  representing a braille character to the corresponding [Unicode braille character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns) 
  for those bits.  You need only support six-bit braille characters.

Within the class, you must store the translation information (from
ASCII to braille, from braille to ASCII, and from braille to Unicode)
as bit trees.  You should put the translation information in a text
file (or maybe I'll get those written in time).

Utility program
---------------

Create a Main class, `BrailleASCII`, that takes two command-line
parameters, the first of which represents the target character set
and the second of which represents the source characters, and that
translates the text.  For example,

```
$ java BrailleASCII braille hello
110010100010111000111000101010
$ java BrailleASCII ascii 110010100010111000111000101010
hello
$ java BrailleASCII unicode hello
⠓⠑⠇⠇⠕
```
