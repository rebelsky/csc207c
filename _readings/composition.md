title: Object composition
summary: |
  We consider a bit about object composition, one of the core techniques
  of object-oriented design, and reflect on some design patterns related
  to composition.

_Forthcoming._

Notes:

* Basic concept should seem obvious. But some subtleties.
* "Wrapper" classes, having the objects do all the work.
* Mixins: Kinda like inheritance, but different.
